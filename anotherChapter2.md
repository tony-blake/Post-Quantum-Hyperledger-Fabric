Here is a detailed scientific summary for each section in Chapter 2, using numerical and mathematical examples to illustrate the concepts:

### 2.1 Floating to the Moon
This section introduces the concept of a **free-float frame** using the thought experiment of a projectile fired vertically from the Earth's surface.

*   A projectile launched upwards will experience a state of **weightlessness**, which is similar to the conditions in a spacecraft coasting towards the Moon.
*   **Example:** A projectile launched to a height of 100 km will provide a weightless environment for its occupants.

### 2.2 The Inertial (Free-Float) Frame
This section defines an **inertial frame**, also known as a **free-float frame**.

*   An inertial frame is a reference frame where an object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.
*   In simpler terms, objects move in straight lines at constant speeds unless something pushes or pulls them.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A spacecraft coasting in deep space with its engines off.
    *   A train moving at a constant velocity on a straight track (ignoring minor frictional forces).

### 2.3 Local Character of Free-Float Frame
This section highlights that a **free-float frame is only truly inertial over a limited region of spacetime**.

*   Gravitational forces cause objects to accelerate towards each other. Thus, a frame inertial for one object may not be inertial for another object far away.
*   Near Earth, objects in free fall experience slightly different accelerations based on their horizontal and vertical separations.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A free-float frame valid for a spacecraft might not be valid for describing the motion of planets in the solar system.
    *   Two ball bearings released 20 meters apart horizontally above Earth's surface will be 10-3 meters closer together after 8 seconds of free fall.
    *  Two ball bearings released 20 meters apart vertically will be 2 x 10-3 meters farther apart after 8 seconds of free fall.

### 2.4 Regions of Spacetime
This section classifies regions of spacetime based on the strength of gravitational effects.

*   Regions where **gravitational effects are negligible** are considered **inertial**.
*   Regions where **gravitational effects are significant** are considered **non-inertial**.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A laboratory on Earth's surface is in a **weak gravitational field**, allowing experiments to assume an inertial frame.
   *   The region near a black hole is in a **strong gravitational field**, where the concept of an inertial frame breaks down.

### 2.5 Test Particle
This section defines a **test particle** as an object with a small mass such that its gravitational influence on other objects is negligible.

*   Test particles are used to probe the properties of spacetime without disturbing it.
*   **Examples:**
    *   An electron moving through an electric field can be treated as a test particle because its mass is so small that its gravitational pull is negligible.
    *   A spacecraft orbiting a planet is not a test particle because its mass is large enough to affect the planet's motion.

### 2.6 Locating Events With a Latticework of Clocks
This section introduces a **latticework of clocks** to **assign coordinates to events in spacetime**.

*   The latticework consists of synchronized clocks distributed throughout space.
*   The coordinates of an event are given by the time on the clock at the event's location and the spatial position of that clock within the lattice.
*   **Example:** An event, like a balloon popping, is assigned coordinates based on the time it happened according to the nearest clock and the clock's position (e.g., '3 meters east and 2 meters north of the corner').

### 2.7 Observer
This section defines an **observer** in special relativity.

*   An observer is a collection of recording devices at rest relative to one another in a given free-float frame.
*   These devices, such as clocks and metersticks, are used to measure the space and time coordinates of events.
*   **Example:** A network of synchronized clocks and measuring rods on a spaceship constitutes an observer in the spaceship's frame of reference.

### 2.8 Measuring Particle Speed
This section explains how to **measure the speed of a particle using the latticework of clocks**.

*   The speed is calculated as the distance traveled by the particle between two events divided by the time elapsed on the latticework of clocks between those events.
*  **Example:** A particle travels 6 meters along the x-axis of a latticework of clocks in 10 meters of time. Its speed is v = 6/10 = 0.6, or 60% the speed of light.

### 2.9 Rocket Frame
This section introduces the concept of a **rocket frame**, which is another **free-float frame in uniform motion relative to the laboratory frame**.

*   Events that occur at the same location in the rocket frame may occur at different locations in the laboratory frame.
*   **Example:** A ball dropping inside a rocket occurs at the same location in the rocket frame, but from the perspective of an observer on Earth, the ball's position changes as it falls because the rocket is moving.

### 2.10 Summary
This section summarizes the key concepts of the chapter.

*   Emphasizes the importance of **inertial frames** and the **local nature of gravity**.
*   Highlights the role of **test particles** in exploring spacetime.
*   Introduces the idea of using a **latticework of clocks** to measure the properties of spacetime.

### Exercise Examples

*   **Exercise 2-1: Human Cannonball:** Describes the motion of a person in an elevator shot from a cannon, showing that the person experiences free-fall and cannot distinguish rising from falling.

*   **Exercise 2-2: Free-Float Bounce:** Analyzes the reading on a scale during bounces on a trampoline, demonstrating that the scale will read zero during free-fall.

*   **Exercise 2-4: Synchronization by a Traveling Clock:** Explores the relativity of simultaneity and how it affects synchronization using a moving clock.
    *  The lack of synchronism is calculated using the Lorentz transformation:
    $$t' = \gamma(t - vx/c^2)$$
    *   The Lorentz factor is:
    $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$
*   **Exercise 2-5: Earth's Surface as a Free-Float Frame:** Explains why experiments testing the equivalence principle in a falling chamber on Earth are still valid despite the Earth accelerating towards the sun.

*   **Exercise 2-6: Horizontal Extent of Free-Float Frame near Earth:** Demonstrates that two ball bearings released horizontally near the Earth's surface move closer together as they fall due to the Earth's curvature. The change in separation can be calculated by using similar triangles:
    $$\frac{a'b'}{ab} = \frac{a'c'}{ac}$$
*   **Exercise 2-7: Spacetime Region:** Calculates the spacetime volume of a given free-float frame in meters by multiplying the spatial and temporal dimensions. For a region 20 meters wide, 20 meters long, 20 meters high, and having a time extent of 1 minute, the spacetime volume is  1.44 x 10^13 m^4.

*   **Exercise 2-8: Limits on Free-Float Frame near Earth:** Calculates how much the separation between two ball bearings released vertically will change by the time they hit Earth, demonstrating the limitations on the extent of free-float frames.

*   **Exercise 2-9: Rising Railway Coach:** Discusses the motion of ball bearings in a railway coach that is either falling or rising, illustrating that there is no observable difference inside the coach.

*   **Exercise 2-10: Test Particle?:** Examines whether a 10 kg particle can be treated as a test particle, showing that a smaller particle would be drawn toward it significantly. The gravitational force is calculated using Newton's Law of Gravitation:
 $$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

*   **Exercise 2-11: Speed Relative to Center of Momentum Frame:** Calculates the velocity of a particle in the rest frame of another particle, using the addition of velocities. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
    $$V = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}$$

*   **Exercise 2-12: Eötvös Experiment:** Analyzes variations of Galileo’s free-fall experiment, highlighting the accuracy of modern experiments testing the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass.

*  **Exercise 2-13: Deflection of Starlight by the Sun:** Calculates the deflection of light by the sun using Newtonian gravity, showing the effective time of fall, net velocity, and the angle of deflection.
    *  **time** = **distance** / **speed**
    *  **velocity** = **acceleration** x **time**
    *  **angle** = **arctan(lateral velocity / velocity of fall)**




Here are the detailed solutions to the exercises in Chapter 2, using the same formatting as in the previous summaries:

### Exercise 2-1: Human Cannonball

**Scenario:** A person rides in an elevator that is shot upward out of a cannon. Neglect air resistance.

*   **(a) While the elevator is still on the way up, the person inside jumps from the "floor" of the elevator. Will the person (1) fall back to the "floor" of the elevator? (2) hit the "ceiling" of the elevator? (3) do something else? If so, what?**

    The person will hit the "ceiling" of the elevator. Both the person and the elevator are in free fall, but the elevator is moving upwards faster than the person.
*   **(b) The person waits to jump until after the elevator has passed the top of its trajectory and is falling back toward Earth. Will your answers to part a be different in this case?**

    No. Both the person and the elevator are in free fall. Since their relative initial velocity is zero at the time of the jump, they will remain at the same height relative to one another.
*   **(c) How can the person riding in the elevator tell when the elevator reaches the top of its trajectory?**

    The rider cannot distinguish rising from falling. At the moment the elevator reaches the top of its trajectory, the rider will feel no force from the floor or ceiling of the elevator. There will be no way to distinguish this moment from any other moment during free fall [12, 2.9].

### Exercise 2-2: Free-Float Bounce

**Scenario:** Test your skill as an acrobat and contortionist! Fasten a weight-measuring bathroom scale under your feet and bounce up and down on a trampoline while reading the scale.

*   **Describe the readings on the scale at different times during the bounces.**
    *   When in contact with the trampoline, the scale will read more than your normal weight because the trampoline is pushing up on you with a force greater than your weight.
    *   At the top of each bounce, the scale will momentarily read zero as you change direction.
    *   During the rest of the free fall, the scale will read zero.
*   **During what part of each jump will the scale have a zero reading?**

    The scale will have a zero reading for most of the jump, whenever you are not in contact with the trampoline.
*  **Neglecting air resistance, what is the longest part of the cycle during which you might consider yourself to be in a free-float frame?**

    The longest part is when you are falling back down towards the trampoline. This is when you are closest to being in a true free-float frame for an extended time, experiencing weightlessness.

### Exercise 2-3: Practical Synchronization of Clocks

**Scenario:** You are in a free-float frame and want to synchronize two clocks, one 10 meters away from you and the other 20 meters away in the same direction. You have a third clock in your hand, set to zero, and want to set your friends' clocks to the correct time as you pass them. You are moving at a constant speed of 0.8 (80% the speed of light) relative to the clocks in the lattice.

*   **How should you set the two clocks as you pass them so they are synchronized in the lattice frame?**

    To synchronize the clocks, you need to account for the time it takes light to travel from your clock to each of your friends' clocks.
    1.  **For the clock 10 meters away:** Since you are moving at 0.8 the speed of light, you will reach the first clock in 10 meters / 0.8 = 12.5 meters of time (the time it takes light to travel 12.5 meters). This is the time you should set on the first clock.
    2.  **For the clock 20 meters away:** You will reach the second clock in 20 meters / 0.8 = 25 meters of time. Therefore, set the second clock to 25 meters of time.

### Exercise 2-4: Synchronization by a Traveling Clock

**Scenario:** Mr. Engelsberg wishes to synchronize two clocks, Big Ben in London and Little Ben in Paris, separated by 300 kilometers.

*   **(a) He uses a third clock, identical in construction with the first two, that travels with a constant velocity between them. As his moving clock passes Big Ben, it is set to read the same time as Big Ben. When the moving clock passes Little Ben, that outpost clock is set to read the same time as the traveling clock. Describe the procedure more completely.**

    Mr. Engelsberg needs to ensure the traveling clock is moving at a **constant speed**, meaning no acceleration or deceleration. As the clock passes each of the stationary clocks, a signal is sent from the traveling clock to the stationary clock to trigger it to match the traveling clock's time. The method for triggering the stationary clocks needs to be very precise and instantaneous.
*   **(b) "Now Big Ben and Little Ben are synchronized," says Mr. Engelsberg. Is he right?**

    He is not correct. Due to the **relativity of simultaneity**, the two events of the traveling clock being synchronized with Big Ben and Little Ben are not simultaneous in the rest frame of the two clocks.
*   **(c) How much out of synchronism are Big Ben and Little Ben as measured by a latticework of clocks — at rest relative to them both — that has been synchronized in the conventional manner using light flashes? Evaluate this lack of synchronism in milliseconds when the traveling clock that Mr. Engelsberg uses moves at 360,000 kilometers/hour, or 105 meters/second.**

    The lack of synchronism can be calculated by determining the time difference between the two synchronization events in the rest frame of the two clocks. This can be done using the **Lorentz transformation**.
    1.  First, calculate the time it takes for the traveling clock to reach Little Ben, as measured by the latticework of clocks. This is simply the distance divided by the speed: 300,000 m / 105 m/s = 3 seconds.
    2.  Next, we need to determine the time difference between the two events as seen in the latticework of clocks. The relevant equation from the Lorentz transformation is:
    $$t' = \gamma(t - vx/c^2)$$
        where:
        *   t' is the time in the moving frame (traveling clock)
        *   t is the time in the stationary frame (latticework of clocks)
        *   v is the relative velocity between the frames (speed of the traveling clock)
        *   x is the distance between the events in the stationary frame (300,000 meters)
        *   c is the speed of light
        *   γ is the Lorentz factor:
            $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$
    3.  Plugging in the values for this scenario, we get:
        $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (10^5 \ m/s)^2/(3 \times 10^8 \ m/s)^2}} \approx 1.000005$$
    4.  The difference in time between the two events as seen in the latticework of clocks is then:
        $$\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = \gamma (t'_2 - vx/c^2) - \gamma (t'_1 - vx/c^2) = \gamma(t'_2 - t'_1) \approx 1.000005 \times 3 \ s \approx 3.000015 \ s$$
        This means that the two events are not simultaneous in the latticework frame, and there is a time difference of approximately 0.000015 seconds, or **15 microseconds**.
*   **(d) Evaluate the lack of synchronism when the traveling clock moves 100 times as fast.**

    If the traveling clock moves 100 times faster, its speed would be 107 m/s. Using the same calculations as above, but with this new speed, we get:
    $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (10^7 \ m/s)^2/(3 \times 10^8 \ m/s)^2}} \approx 1.005$$
    The time difference between the two events in the latticework frame would then be:
     $$\Delta t \approx 1.005 \times 3 \ s \approx 3.015 \ s$$
    This means that at the higher speed, the lack of synchronism increases to approximately 0.015 seconds, or **15 milliseconds**.
*   **(e) Is there any earthly reason — aside from matters of personal preference — why we all should not adopt the method of synchronization used by Mr. Engelsberg?**

    Yes, there is a very important earthly reason. Mr. Engelsberg's method violates the **principle of relativity**. His method gives a privileged position to the frame of reference of the traveling clock. Furthermore, it leads to inconsistent results when applied to multiple clocks moving at different speeds. The conventional method of synchronization using light flashes is consistent with the principle of relativity and provides a consistent framework for measuring time across different reference frames.

### Exercise 2-5: Earth's Surface as a Free-Float Frame

**Scenario:** A worried student writes, "In the modern experiment to test the equivalence principle the experimenters measured the relative acceleration of different materials toward...the Sun...But the Earth is accelerating toward the Sun, so how can they say that their falling chamber approximates a free-float frame?"

*   **Write a response to this student.**

    The student raises a valid concern. The Earth is indeed accelerating toward the Sun due to gravity. However, the key to understanding this experiment lies in the concept of the ***local*** nature of free-float frames.
    The falling chamber used in the experiment is in free fall towards the Earth. Over the short distance and time of the experiment, the acceleration of the chamber towards the Sun is essentially constant for all the objects within it. This means that, relative to the chamber, the objects inside are not experiencing any additional acceleration towards the Sun. In other words, the chamber approximates a free-float frame for the duration of the experiment, even though it is itself accelerating towards the Sun.
    The experimenters are not trying to eliminate the gravitational force of the Sun altogether. They are measuring the extremely small *differences* in acceleration between different materials towards the Sun, as predicted by the equivalence principle. The falling chamber serves to isolate the experiment from other forces and accelerations, such as those due to the Earth's rotation and variations in its gravitational field, allowing for a more precise measurement of this subtle effect.

### Exercise 2-6: Horizontal Extent of Free-Float Frame near Earth

**Scenario:** Consider two ball bearings near the surface of Earth and originally separated horizontally by 20 meters (Section 2.3).

*   **Demonstrate that when released from rest (relative to Earth), the particles move closer together by 1 millimeter as they fall 315 meters, using the following method of similar triangles or some other method.**

    1.  **Visualize the Setup:** Imagine two ball bearings, A and B, separated horizontally by 20 meters above the Earth's surface. Draw lines from each ball bearing towards the center of the Earth. These lines will converge slightly due to the Earth's curvature.
    2.  **Similar Triangles:** The lines to the Earth's center, along with the horizontal line connecting the ball bearings and a vertical line from one ball bearing to the Earth's surface, form similar triangles. The small triangle (a'b'c') formed near the ball bearings is similar to the larger triangle (abc) formed with the Earth's radius.
    3.  **Geometry:**
        *   Side a'c' (vertical fall) = 315 meters
        *   Side ac (Earth's radius) = 6,371,000 meters
        *   Side ab (half the horizontal separation) = 10 meters
        *   Side a'b' = the change in separation between the ball bearings as they fall.
    4.  **Ratios:** Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
        $$\frac{a'b'}{ab} = \frac{a'c'}{ac}$$
    5.  **Solve for a'b':**
        $$a'b' = ab \times \frac{a'c'}{ac} = 10 \ m \times \frac{315 \ m}{6,371,000 \ m} \approx 0.0005 \ m = 0.5 \ mm$$
    **Conclusion:** Since a'b' represents half the change in separation, the total change in separation is 2 * a'b', which is 1 millimeter. This demonstrates that as the ball bearings fall towards Earth, their horizontal separation decreases slightly due to the convergence of their paths towards the Earth's center.

### Exercise 2-7: Spacetime Region

**Scenario:** A free-float frame is 20 meters wide, 20 meters long, 20 meters high, and has a time extent of 1 minute.

*   **What is the spacetime volume of this region, in meters?**

    1.  First, convert the time extent to meters. One minute is 60 seconds. Using the conversion factor from the source, 1 second = 3 x 108 meters, we get: 60 s * 3 x 108 m/s = 18 x 109 meters.
    2.  Now, calculate the spacetime volume by multiplying the spatial dimensions by the time dimension:
        20 m * 20 m * 20 m * 18 x 10^9 m = **1.44 x 10^13 m^4**

### Exercise 2-8: Limits on Free-Float Frame near Earth

**Scenario:** You are in a free-float elevator 20 meters long, initially at rest 315 meters above the surface of Earth. You release two tiny ball bearings at opposite ends of the elevator.

*   **By how much will the separation between these ball bearings have changed by the time they hit Earth, 8 seconds after release?**

    The problem states the ball bearings will move apart by **2 millimeters**. This is because the ball bearing closer to the Earth will experience a slightly stronger gravitational acceleration than the ball bearing further away.
    You can also approximate this result using the equation derived in Exercise 2-6. However, instead of using half the horizontal separation, use the full vertical separation of 20 meters for 'ab', giving a separation change of 2 millimeters.

### Exercise 2-9: Rising Railway Coach

**Scenario:** Imagine an antique railway coach with a length of 20 meters.

*   **(a) Suppose this railway coach is dropped from rest in a vertical orientation, with the lower end of the coach initially 315 meters above the surface of Earth. You release two tiny ball bearings from rest at opposite ends of the coach. What will be the change in separation of the ball bearings during the time of fall (8 seconds)? Compare with the change in separation for horizontal separation.**

    The change in separation for vertical orientation is **2 millimeters** [34, 2.3]. This is twice the change in separation for horizontal separation, which is 1 millimeter [34, 2.3].
*   **(b) The railway coach is now rocket-powered and is rising at a constant speed with respect to Earth’s surface (not shown). Again, you release two ball bearings at opposite ends of the coach and at rest with respect to the coach. Will you observe these ball bearings to move together or apart?**

    The ball bearings will move **closer together** at the same rate they would if the coach were stationary relative to the Earth's surface. Inside the coach, which is an inertial frame, there is no difference between constant upward motion and being at rest.
*   **(c) In either of the cases described above, can you, the rider in the railway coach, distinguish whether the coach is rising or falling with respect to the surface of Earth solely by observing the ball bearings from inside the coach? What do you observe at the moment the coach stops rising with respect to Earth and begins to fall?**

    No, you cannot distinguish rising from falling solely by observing the ball bearings. Both motions result in free fall within the coach. At the moment the coach stops rising and begins to fall, there will be no observable change inside the coach. The transition will be seamless [36, 2.9].

### Exercise 2-10: Test Particle?

**Scenario:** You wish to test whether a certain particle of mass 10 kilograms can be treated as a test particle. You place a less massive particle a distance of 0.1 meter away from it.

*   **(a) Verify the statement in Section 2.5 that a candidate test particle of mass 10 kilograms placed 0.1 meter from a less massive particle (initially stationary with respect to it) draws the second toward it by 1 millimeter in less than 3 minutes. If this relative motion is detectable by equipment in use at the test site, the result disqualifies the 10-kilogram particle as a "test particle." Assume that both particles are spherically symmetric. Use Newton’s Law of Gravitation:**
    $$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
     **where the gravitation constant *G* has the value *G* = 6.673 × 10-11 meter3/(kilogram-second2). Assume that this force does not change appreciably as the particles decrease separation by 1 millimeter.**

    To solve this, we need to use **Newton's Law of Gravitation** and **Newton's Second Law of Motion** (F = ma).
    1.  **Calculate the gravitational force:** Using Newton's Law of Gravitation, we can find the force of attraction between the two particles. Let M = 10 kg and m be the mass of the smaller particle. The distance, r = 0.1 m.
        $$F = \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11} \ m^3/kg \cdot s^2)(10 \ kg)m}{(0.1 \ m)^2} = (6.673 \times 10^{-8} \ m/s^2)m$$
    2.  **Calculate the acceleration of the smaller particle:** Using F = ma, where F is the force calculated above and 'a' is the acceleration of the smaller particle.
        $$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-8} \ m/s^2)m}{m} = 6.673 \times 10^{-8} \ m/s^2$$
    3.  **Calculate the time to move 1 millimeter:** We can use the equation of motion:
        $$\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
        where:
        *   Δx is the displacement (1 mm = 10-3 m)
        *  v0 is the initial velocity (0 m/s)
        *   a is the acceleration (6.673 × 10-8 m/s2)
        *   t is the time
    4. Since the initial velocity is zero, the equation simplifies to:
        $$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
    5.  Solving for *t*, we get:
        $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta x}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \ m}{6.673 \times 10^{-8} \ m/s^2}} \approx 173 \ s$$
    6.  **Convert to minutes:** 173 seconds is a little less than 3 minutes.
    **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the smaller particle will move 1 millimeter towards the 10 kg particle in a little less than 3 minutes. If this motion is detectable, then the 10 kg particle cannot be considered a test particle.
*   **(b) Section 2.3 describes two ball bearings released 20 meters apart horizontally in a freely falling railway coach. They move 1 millimeter closer together during 8 seconds of free fall, showing the limitations on this inertial frame. Verify that these ball bearings qualify as test particles by estimating the distance one of these ball bearings, treated as a test particle, would have to fall from rest in order to move 1 millimeter toward the other because of their mutual gravitational attraction. Compare this distance with the Earth-Moon separation (3.8 × 108 meters).**

    To verify that the ball bearings qualify as test particles, we can use a similar approach as in part (a), but working backwards to find the distance required for a 1 mm displacement due to their mutual gravitational attraction. We'll assume each ball bearing has a mass of 1 kg.
    1.  **Estimate the force:** We know the ball bearings move 1 mm closer together over 8 seconds of free fall. We can estimate the acceleration needed for this using the equation of motion. Assuming constant acceleration:
    $$\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
    2.  Since the initial velocity is zero:
    $$a = \frac{2 \Delta x}{t^2} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \ m}{(8 \ s)^2} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-5} \ m/s^2$$
    3.  Now, using F = ma, we can estimate the force:
        $$F = ma \approx (1 \ kg)(3.1 \times 10^{-5} \ m/s^2) \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-5} \ N$$
    4. **Calculate the distance:** Using Newton's Law of Gravitation:
        $$r = \sqrt{\frac{GMm}{F}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11} \ m^3/kg \cdot s^2)(1 \ kg)(1 \ kg)}{3.1 \times 10^{-5} \ N}} \approx 0.015 \ m = 1.5 \ cm$$
     **Conclusion:** For the ball bearings to move 1 mm closer together due to their mutual gravitational attraction, they would need to be incredibly close, just 1.5 cm apart. This is drastically smaller than the Earth-Moon separation, indicating that the gravitational attraction between the ball bearings is extremely weak and they can be considered test particles. Their movement within the railway coach is primarily due to the non-uniform gravitational field of the Earth.

### Exercise 2-11: Speed Relative to Center of Momentum Frame

**Scenario:** Two particles of mass *m* each have equal and opposite velocities of magnitude *v'* in their center-of-momentum frame, so that their total momentum is zero. What is the magnitude of the velocity of each particle as measured in the rest frame of the other particle?

*   **Using the addition of velocities, show that this speed is**
    $$V = \frac{2v'}{1 + v'^2}$$
    1.  **Relative Motion:** In the rest frame of one particle (let's call it particle A), the other particle (particle B) is moving towards it with a speed of *v'*.
    2.  **Velocity Addition:** To find the velocity of particle B as measured by particle A, we use the **relativistic velocity addition formula**:
        $$V = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}$$
        where:
        *   V is the combined velocity
        *   *v1* is the velocity of particle B in the center-of-momentum frame (*v'*)
        *   *v2* is the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame relative to particle A (also *v'*, since the center-of-momentum frame is moving at *v'* relative to each particle)
        *   *c* is the speed of light
    3.  **Substituting:** Substitute the values into the formula:
        $$V = \frac{v' + v'}{1 + \frac{v'v'}{c^2}} = \frac{2v'}{1 + \frac{v'^2}{c^2}}$$
    4.  **Simplification:** Since we're working with speeds as fractions of the speed of light (*v'* represents v'/c), the *c2* terms cancel out, leaving:
        $$V = \frac{2v'}{1 + v'^2}$$
    This is the velocity of particle B as measured by particle A, which is what we wanted to find.

### Exercise 2-12: Eötvös Experiment

**Scenario:** In 1889, Loránd Eötvös carried out an improved version of Galileo's experiment to test the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass. By balancing the gravitational force on one object with the inertial force on another object in a rotating system, Eötvös was able to show that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass was the same for different materials to within one part in 109. In 1964, Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke improved on Eötvös’s method, achieving an accuracy of three parts in 1011.

*   **(a) Imagine repeating Galileo’s free-fall experiment in an Earth laboratory. Drop balls of gold and copper simultaneously from the same height. Assume that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass for copper is 1.000001 times this ratio for gold. Calculate how far behind the gold ball the copper ball is when the gold ball hits the floor after falling 1 meter.**

    Since the copper ball has a slightly higher ratio of gravitational to inertial mass, it will accelerate slightly slower towards the Earth compared to the gold ball. We can use the equations of motion to calculate the difference in distance fallen after 1 meter.
    1.  **Set up the equations:** Let's denote the acceleration due to gravity for gold as *g* and for copper as *g'*. Since the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass for copper is 1.000001 times that of gold, *g'* = 0.999999*g*.
        We'll use the following equation of motion for both balls, starting from rest:
        $$d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
        where:
        *   *d* is the distance fallen
        *   *g* is the acceleration due to gravity
        *   *t* is the time
    2.  **Solve for time:** Since both balls are dropped from the same height, they will hit the ground at the same time. Solving the equation for *t* for the gold ball:
        $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(1 \ m)}{g}}$$
    3.  **Calculate the distance fallen by the copper ball:** Now, plug this value of *t* into the equation for the copper ball:
        $$d' = \frac{1}{2}g't^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0.999999g)\left(\sqrt{\frac{2(1 \ m)}{g}}\right)^2 = 0.999999 \ m$$
    4.  **Find the difference:** The difference in distance fallen is:
        $$d - d' = 1 \ m - 0.999999 \ m = 1 \times 10^{-6} \ m = 1 \ \mu m$$
    **Conclusion:** The copper ball will be 1 micrometer behind the gold ball when the gold ball hits the floor.
*   **(b) The result of the more modern Dicke experiment is that the fraction**
    $$\frac{\Delta g}{g} $$
    **is not greater than 3 × 10-11. Assume that the fraction has this more recently determined maximum value. Reckon how far behind the first ball the second one will be when the first reaches the ground if they are dropped simultaneously from the top of a 46-meter vacuum chamber. Under these same circumstances, how far would balls of different materials have to fall in a vacuum in a uniform gravitational field of 10 meters/second/second for one ball to lag behind the other one by a distance of 1 millimeter? Compare this distance with the Earth-Moon separation (3.8 × 108 meters). Clearly, the Dicke experiment was not carried out using falling balls!**

    We will follow a similar process as part (a), but with the updated value for the fractional difference in acceleration and a different height.
    1.  **Calculate the difference in acceleration:** Given Δg/g = 3 x 10-11 and g = 9.8 m/s2 (approximate acceleration due to gravity), the difference in acceleration between the two balls is:
        $$\Delta g = (3 \times 10^{-11})(9.8 \ m/s^2) \approx 2.94 \times 10^{-10} \ m/s^2$$
    2.  **Calculate the time of fall:** Using the equation of motion for the first ball:
        $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(46 \ m)}{9.8 \ m/s^2}} \approx 3.06 \ s$$
    3.  **Calculate the difference in distance:** The difference in distance fallen can be calculated using:
        $$\Delta d = \frac{1}{2}\Delta gt^2 \approx \frac{1}{2}(2.94 \times 10^{-10} \ m/s^2)(3.06 \ s)^2 \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-9} \ m$$
    4.  **Calculate the distance for a 1 mm difference:** To find the distance needed for a 1 mm difference, we can rearrange the equation from step 3 and use a uniform gravitational field of g = 10 m/s2:
        $$d = \frac{2\Delta d}{\Delta g t^2} = \frac{2 (10^{-3} \ m)}{(3 \times 10^{-11})(10 \ m/s^2)(t^2)}$$
        Since we don't know the time *t*, we can rewrite it using the equation of motion:
        $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}}$$
    5. Substituting this into the equation for *d*:
        $$d = \frac{2(10^{-3} \ m)}{(3 \times 10^{-11})(10 \ m/s^2) \left(\sqrt{\frac{2d}{10 \ m/s^2}}\right)^2}$$
    6.  Simplifying and solving for *d*:
        $$d \approx 1.83 \times 10^{16} \ m$$
    7.  **Compare to Earth-Moon distance:** This distance (1.83 × 1016 meters) is significantly larger than the Earth-Moon separation (3.8 × 108 meters).
    **Conclusion:** The Dicke experiment was able to detect minuscule differences in acceleration that would require an enormous distance of free fall to manifest as a 1 mm difference in a typical Earth laboratory. The precision of this experiment highlights the importance of sophisticated techniques for testing fundamental physics principles.
*   **(c) A plumb bob of mass *m* hangs on the end of a long line from the ceiling of a closed room, as shown in the first figure (left). A very massive sphere at one side of the closed room exerts a horizontal gravitational force *mgs* on the plumb bob, where *gs* = *GM/R2*, *M* is the mass of the large sphere, and *R* the distance between the plumb bob and the center of the sphere. This horizontal force causes a static deflection of the plumb line from the vertical by the small angle *θ*. (Similar practical example: In northern India, the mass of the Himalaya Mountains results in a slight sideways deflection of plumb lines, causing difficulties in precise surveying.) The sphere is now rolled around to a corresponding position on the other side of the room (right), causing a static deflection of the plumb by an angle *θ* of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction. Suppose that the experimenters now carry out the Dicke experiment with a test mass at the end of a fiber instead of using a freely falling mass. They look for a difference in the angle of deflection of this pendulum as the massive sphere is rolled from one side of the closed room to the other. This difference in angle is proportional to the difference in acceleration Δ*g* of the test mass toward the sphere. (Additional differences in angle due to other effects — for example, a change in the gravitational pull of the sphere on the fiber itself — cancel out when the sphere is rolled to the opposite side of the room.) Analyze the sensitivity of this method for measuring**
    $$\frac{\Delta g}{g}$$
    **taking into account the following points. First, the angle *θ* is very small, so sin *θ* ≈ *θ* and tan *θ* ≈ *θ*. Second, in the actual experiment the sphere is not moved from side to side but rather rotated continuously about the central fiber. Third, the rotating sphere exerts a tiny fluctuating horizontal gravitational force on the test mass, driving the pendulum into oscillation at its natural period. The experimenters measure the amplitude of this oscillation, which is proportional to the difference in acceleration.**

    1.  **Analyze forces and angles:** In the presence of the massive sphere, the plumb bob experiences two forces: the gravitational force *mg* from the Earth and the horizontal gravitational force *mgs* from the sphere. The plumb bob will come to rest at a position where these forces balance. Since the angle *θ* is small, we can approximate:
        $$\tan \theta \approx \theta = \frac{mg_s}{mg} = \frac{g_s}{g}$$
    2.  **Relate angle difference to Δg:** The difference in deflection angle when the sphere is moved to the other side is 2*θ*. This difference is proportional to the difference in acceleration Δ*g*. Therefore, we have:
        $$2\theta \propto \Delta g$$
    3.  **Sensitivity of the measurement:** Combining the equations from steps 1 and 2, we can relate the fractional difference in acceleration to the angle:
        $$\frac{\Delta g}{g} \propto 2\theta$$
    This shows that the sensitivity of the measurement is directly proportional to the angle *θ*.
    4.  **Continuous rotation and oscillation:** By continuously rotating the sphere, the experimenters create a fluctuating gravitational force that drives the pendulum into oscillation. The amplitude of this oscillation is a more sensitive measure of the difference in acceleration than simply observing the static deflection angle. This is because the amplitude can be amplified over time, allowing for the detection of much smaller effects.
     **Conclusion:** This method, by measuring the oscillation amplitude of a test mass under the influence
