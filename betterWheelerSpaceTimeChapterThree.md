Okay, here is a detailed scientific summary for each section in Chapter 3, with numerical and mathematical examples, and formatted as requested:

**3.1 The Principle of Relativity**

*   This section introduces the **Principle of Relativity**, which states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.
*   It begins with everyday examples to illustrate that without external references, it's impossible to tell if you are moving or at rest.
*   Galileo's thought experiment involving a ship with closed windows is used to demonstrate this principle.
    *   In this thought experiment, the motion of objects inside the ship is described the same way, regardless of whether the ship is moving uniformly or at rest.
*   The principle is extended from ships to spaceships to introduce the concept of **inertial reference frames** or free-float frames.
    *   In these frames, objects not acted upon by a force maintain a constant velocity.
*   Einsteinâ€™s principle of relativity generalizes these ideas, saying the laws of physics, including electromagnetism and nuclear physics, are the same in all inertial reference frames.

**3.2 What Is Not the Same in Different Frames**

*   This section clarifies that while the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, many measurements are not.
*   **Space separations, time separations, velocities, accelerations, forces, and fields** are all quantities that can differ depending on the observer's frame of reference.
    *   For example, a ball falling straight down on one ship will appear to follow a parabolic course when viewed from another ship that is moving relative to the first.
*   The section discusses how velocity is measured: by dividing the change in position by the change in time.
    *   Because space and time measurements differ between reference frames, the calculated velocity will also differ.
*   Similarly, forces and fields can differ between frames because they are related to acceleration.
*   The discussion extends to the nature of measurement units, highlighting the arbitrary nature of the meter and second and how they are defined
*   The speed of light (c) is defined as 299,792,458 meters per second.

**3.3 What Is the Same in Different Frames**

*   Despite differences in measured quantities, **the laws of physics and fundamental physical constants remain the same** in all inertial reference frames.
*   The mathematical forms of the laws of physics do not change.
*   Fundamental physical constants, such as the charge of an electron and the speed of light in a vacuum, are the same in all inertial frames.
*   The speed of light is a constant in all free-float frames.
*   **Example:**
    *   The relationship between force and acceleration (Newton's Second Law) is the same in all inertial frames, even though the numerical values of force and acceleration might be different.

*   A sample problem is given to illustrate which quantities are the same and which are not.
    *   The speed of light is the same.
    *   The charge on an electron is the same.
    *   The order of elements in the periodic table is the same.
    *   Newton's First Law is the same.
    *   Speed, kinetic energy, electric field, and time between events are not necessarily the same.

**3.4 Relativity of Simultaneity**

*   This section introduces the idea that **simultaneity is relative**, meaning that two events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another frame that is moving relative to the first.
*   Einstein's **Train Paradox** is used to illustrate this concept.
    *   In this thought experiment, lightning strikes the front and back of a moving train.
    *   An observer on the ground sees the strikes as simultaneous, as the light from both strikes reach him at the same time because he is standing halfway between the char marks on the track.
    *   However, an observer on the train sees the lightning strike the front of the train first because, according to the ground observer, the train is moving toward the flash from the front and away from the flash coming from the rear.
*   The key concept is that simultaneity depends on the observer's frame of reference.
*   Simultaneity is absolute only if the events occur at the same location, or are only separated in a direction transverse to the direction of relative motion.
*   The relativity of simultaneity is a difficult concept, and misconceptions about it often lead to paradoxes.

**3.5 Lorentz Contraction of Length**

*   This section explains that the **length of a moving object is measured to be shorter** along its direction of motion than when it is at rest, and this effect is known as Lorentz contraction.
*   The section emphasizes that to measure the length of a moving rod, one must mark the location of its two ends at the same time using a latticework of clocks.
    *   Because simultaneity is relative, the method of measurement will affect the result.
*   The Train Paradox is revisited to illustrate that the earth-based observer measures the train to be shorter than the train-based observer.
    *   The train observer believes that the lightning strikes happened at different times in the earth-based frame of reference, therefore the earth-based measurement of the length of the train is invalid.
*   The length measured in the object's rest frame is called its **proper length**.
*   The Lorentz contraction is not something that can be "seen" with the eye due to the finite speed of light.
    *   Measurements are made using the latticework of rods and clocks.

**3.6 Invariance of Transverse Dimension**

*   This section explains that **dimensions perpendicular to the direction of motion do not change**.
*   The section uses thought experiments such as a speeding train with wheels on tracks, and two pipe segments hurtling towards each other to show why transverse dimensions do not contract.
    *   If transverse dimensions changed, it would lead to logical contradictions.
*   An argument about axes of shrinkage is used to show that there is no logically consistent way to define a transverse contraction, therefore transverse dimensions must be invariant.
*   If events are simultaneous in one frame and separated only by a transverse distance then they are also simultaneous in another frame.

**3.7 Invariance of the Interval Proved**

*   This section shows that despite the relative nature of space and time measurements, **there is an invariant quantity: the spacetime interval**.
*   This interval is calculated by taking the square of the time separation minus the square of the space separation between two events.
*   A light clock thought experiment is used to illustrate that the time between two events is different in different frames, but the spacetime interval is the same.
    *   The light clock involves a flash of light emitted from a clock and reflected back by a mirror.
    *   For a moving clock, the light travels a longer path as measured in the lab frame which means more time elapses.
*   **Example:**
    *   In the rocket frame, light travels 6 meters of distance and therefore has a time separation of 6 meters.
        *   Space separation = 0 meters.
        *   Interval = $6^2 - 0^2 = 36$ $meters^2$
    *   In the lab frame the light travels a distance of 10 meters at lightspeed for a time separation of 10 meters, and has a space separation of 8 meters.
        *   Interval = $10^2 - 8^2 = 100 - 64 = 36$ $meters^2$
        *   The interval is the same in both frames, 36 $meters^2$
    *    The interval itself is then $\sqrt{36}$ meters, or 6 meters

*   The spacetime interval is an invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial frames.
    *   The fact that it is invariant is a direct consequence of the Principle of Relativity..

**3.8 Invariance of the Interval for All Free-Float Frames**

*   This section expands on the previous one, demonstrating that the spacetime interval is invariant **regardless of the relative speed of the inertial frames**.
*   A "super-rocket" frame, moving at a different speed from the laboratory and rocket frames, is introduced to confirm the invariance of the interval.
    *   The super-rocket observer measures different space and time separations but calculates the same spacetime interval.
*   **Example:**
    *   In the super-rocket frame, the time separation is 20.88 meters, and space separation is 20 meters.
        *   Interval = $20.88^2 - 20^2 = 436 - 400 = 36$ $meters^2$.
        *  The interval remains invariant at 36 $meters^2$

*   This section further solidifies the concept of the invariant interval as a cornerstone of special relativity.

**3.9 Summary**

*   This section summarizes the key concepts of the chapter.
*   The principle of relativity states that physical laws are the same in every inertial frame of reference.
*   The main consequences of this principle are:
    *   Relativity of simultaneity.
    *   Lorentz contraction of length.
    *   Invariance of transverse dimension.
    *   Simultaneity is absolute for events separated only transversely to relative motion.
    *   Invariance of the spacetime interval.
    *   No object can travel faster than light.
*   The interval is defined as $ (time \ separation)^2 - (space \ separation)^2$ .
*  It concludes that the Principle of Relativity underlies the invariant interval.

**Box 3-3: Faster Than Light?**

*   This box explores the question of whether anything can travel faster than light, concluding that the answer is no.
    *   Going faster than light would violate causality.
*   The formula $(t')^2 = t^2 - x^2$ shows a way that the time separation between events in one frame is related to the time and space separation of those events in another frame. This leads to the conclusion that the time interval would become imaginary for objects moving faster than light.
    *   It would lead to the result that an object could arrive before it starts.
*   The box explains that while nothing can travel faster than light, we can travel to any remote star in a short time on a rocket by approaching the speed of light, although a very long time will have passed on Earth.

**Box 3-4: Does a Moving Clock Really "Run Slow"?**

*   This box addresses the misconception that a moving clock has some internal changes that make it run slow.
*   The text clarifies that the time measured between clock ticks is shorter in the rest frame of the clock than in a frame where the clock is moving, but no physical change is happening inside the clock.
    *  This is verified by experiment involving short-lived particles.
*   The rate of time is determined by the observer's motion, not by any change in the clock.
    *    The observer can make a clock move or not move relative to them, at will, by changing their velocity.
    *   The clock does not change its structure or operations based on the observer's motion.
*    Proper time is the wristwatch time that is the time between ticks in a frame where the clock is at rest and is invariant and the same for all observers.

These summaries provide a detailed explanation of each section of Chapter 3, complete with numerical and mathematical examples and formatted as requested.

*   **Table 3-1** summarizes the different measurements of space and time in rocket and laboratory frames, yet shows how they result in the same spacetime interval.
*   The interval is invariant, meaning that it has the same value for all observers in inertial frames, despite disagreements about space and time separations individually.
*   The invariance of the interval is a central result of special relativity, demonstrating that there is no absolute time difference between two events.

### 3.9 Summary

*   This section summarizes the key concepts of the chapter, emphasizing that **the laws of physics are the same in every inertial (free-float) reference frame**.
*   It reiterates several consequences of the Principle of Relativity:
    *   **Relativity of simultaneity:** Events simultaneous in one frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another frame if they are separated in the direction of motion.
    *   **Lorentz contraction:** An object in high-speed motion is measured to be shorter along its direction of motion than its proper length (measured in its rest frame).
    *   **Invariance of transverse distances:** Dimensions of moving objects perpendicular to the motion are measured to be the same in different frames.
    *   **Simultaneity of transverse events:** Events with separation only transverse to the motion that are simultaneous in one frame are also simultaneous in all frames.
*   The chapter concludes by noting that the **rocket time can be very much smaller than the laboratory time** as the rocket approaches the speed of light. This means that in principle, one can go to any remote star in a short time, despite speed limits.
*   The text stresses that while our speed is limited by the speed of light, the distance we can travel is unlimited.
*   **The invariance of the interval is based on the principle of relativity** and is due to both invariance of transverse distance and invariance of the speed of light.

### Other Key Concepts from Exercises

*   **Sample Problem 3-2, the K+ Meson:** The half-life of a particle in its own rest frame can be calculated by measuring the decay rate in a laboratory frame and using the invariant interval.
    *   For example, if a beam of K+ mesons travels 9 meters and only one quarter of them survive, this corresponds to two half-lives.
*   **Relativity and Swimming (Exercise 3-1):**  A swimmer takes different amounts of time to swim a distance with and against a current; this is different than the case of light, whose speed is always the same relative to all observers.
*   **Einstein Puzzler (Exercise 3-2):** A runner will always see herself in the mirror, even at speeds close to the speed of light.
*  **Construction of Clocks (Exercise 3-3):** All clocks will run at the same rate relative to one another within a free-float frame, even when that rate is different when measured from another free-float frame.
*   **Principle of Relativity (Exercise 3-4):** Quantities like the spacetime interval and the structure of DNA are the same in overlapping free-float frames, but things like the kinetic energy of an electron and the magnetic field at a point are not.
*   **Down with Relativity! (Exercise 3-6):** Presents objections to relativity and then answers them, highlighting that the theory is logical and self-consistent.
*   **Cerenkov Radiation (Exercise 3-8):** Explores Cerenkov radiation, which is emitted when particles travel faster than light in a medium, showing that the angle of the light cone is related to the particle's speed in that medium: $$\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v}$$,.
    *   For example, the minimum velocity for Cerenkov radiation in Lucite is 2/3 the speed of light and in water, the minimum is 0.75 the speed of light.
*   **Aberration of Starlight (Exercise 3-9):**  The apparent direction of starlight changes due to the motion of the observer, and the aberration angle can be calculated using trigonometry.
    *   The angle of aberration can be calculated as $$\tan \psi = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}$$, and Earth's motion causes an apparent shift of about 20.5 seconds of arc.
*   **The Expanding Universe (Exercise 3-10):** Observation of light from stars can be used to verify the expansion of the universe by analyzing the red shift of the light using the Doppler effect.
    *   The recession velocity of stars can be determined by comparing observed and proper periods of spectral lines.
    *   For example, a quasar with a redshift of 5.9 has a velocity of 0.94 the speed of light.
*  **Law of Addition of Velocities (Exercise 3-11):** Two speeds cannot simply be added together; relativistic addition of velocities is given by: $$V_{\text{combined}} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}$$.
    *  When dealing with everyday speeds, the equation simplifies to the simple addition of velocities.
*  **Michelson-Morley Experiment (Exercise 3-12):** This experiment failed to detect the motion of Earth through the "ether".
    *   The time difference between light traveling in perpendicular directions is extremely small, but the use of interference allows it to be observed, and the results of the experiment are explained by the fact that the speed of light is constant in every inertial frame.
*  **The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment (Exercise 3-13):** This experiment tested the isotropy of the speed of light and measured the change in interference patterns between paths of unequal length due to motion.
    *   The results of the experiment are consistent with the speed of light being the same in all inertial frames and that a clock's frequency is not affected by the velocity.
*  **Things That Move Faster Than Light (Exercise 3-14):** Objects such as the point of intersection of a long rod and the axis along which the rod moves can move faster than light, but these cannot be used to transmit information faster than light.
* **Four Times the Speed of Light? (Exercise 3-15):** An approaching rocket can appear to move faster than the speed of light due to the way that we receive light from the rocket as it moves, while a receding rocket will never appear to move away at more than half the speed of light.
*   **Superluminal Expansion of Quasar 3C273? (Exercise 3-16):** The apparent speed of separation of parts of a quasar can be greater than the speed of light due to the geometry of how the light reaches the observer from a source moving at relativistic speeds.
    *   The apparent time separation is given by: $$\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = \Delta t \left(1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos\theta\right)$$, and the apparent transverse speed is given by: $$v_{\text{seen, max}} = \frac{v}{1 - v^2}$$.
* **Contraction or Rotation (Exercise 3-17):** Explores how a moving cube will be seen with the eye versus how it will be measured by a latticework of clocks. The cube will appear rotated due to the time it takes for light from different points to reach the viewer, with the angle of rotation being given by: $$\tan \phi = v$$, where v is the velocity of the cube in the laboratory frame.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and examples discussed in Chapter 3 of the source material.


Okay, here are the detailed solutions to the exercises in Chapter 3, using the same formatting style as before for the mathematical parts, and bolding key concepts for emphasis:

### Exercise 3-1: Relativity and Swimming

This exercise contrasts the behavior of a swimmer with that of light to highlight the principle of relativity.

**(a) Swimmer in a Stationary Pool**

*   **Distance:** 30 meters down and 30 meters back = 60 meters
*   **Speed:** 1 meter/second
*   **Time:** $\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{60 \text{ meters}}{1 \text{ m/s}} = 60 \text{ seconds}$

**(b) Swimmer in a Moving Pool**

*   **Speed of Floats:** 1/3 meter/second
    *   When swimming in the direction of the floats, the swimmerâ€™s speed relative to the floats is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 m/s. The distance to travel is 30 m. $\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ m}}{2/3 \text{ m/s}} = 45 \text{ seconds}$
    *   When swimming against the direction of the floats, the swimmerâ€™s speed relative to the floats is 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 m/s. The distance to travel is 30 m. $\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ m}}{4/3 \text{ m/s}} = 22.5 \text{ seconds}$
*   **Total Time (A to B and back):** 45 seconds + 22.5 seconds = 67.5 seconds

**(c) Time Dependence on Reference System**

*   No, the total time from A to B and back again **is dependent** on the reference system, the time is different for the stationary pool versus the moving floats.

**(d) Key Difference between Swimmer and Light**

*   **The speed of light is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion, while the speed of the swimmer depends on the motion of the medium and the observer's frame.**

### Exercise 3-2: Einstein Puzzler

*   **Principle of Relativity:** The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (free-float) reference frames.
*   **Analysis:** If the runner is in a free-float frame, she cannot tell if she is moving. The mirror reflects light, and if she holds the mirror at arm's length, she will always be able to see her reflection. The relative motion between the runner and the mirror is what matters; as long as the runner and the mirror are not accelerating relative to each other, the image will be normal.

### Exercise 3-3: Construction of Clocks

*   **Argument:** All clocks, when accelerated together to a high speed in a rocket and then allowed to move at a constant speed, will measure the same time in the rocket's free-float frame as one another. This is because the laws of physics are the same in all free-float frames; thus all clocks, regardless of their internal mechanisms, will experience time at the same rate relative to the rocket.
*   **Clock Rate:** The rocket observer **will not** measure the same rate for these clocks as a laboratory observer. Because of time dilation, the lab observer will measure time passing more slowly in the rocket.

### Exercise 3-4: The Principle of Relativity

This exercise tests understanding of quantities that are invariant vs. relative.

*   **(a) Time for light to travel one meter in a vacuum:** **Yes**, this is a fundamental constant.
*   **(b) Spacetime interval between two events:** **Yes**, this is invariant.
*   **(c) Kinetic energy of an electron:** **No**, this depends on the frame of reference.
*   **(d) Value of the mass of the electron:** **Yes**, mass is invariant.
*   **(e) Value of the magnetic field at a given point:** **No**, electric and magnetic fields transform between frames.
*   **(f) Distance between two events:** **No**, length is relative.
*   **(g) Structure of the DNA molecule:** **Yes**, this is a physical property that does not depend on the observer's motion.
*   **(h) Time rate of change of momentum of a neutron:** **No**, both the momentum and the rate of change are relative.

### Exercise 3-5: Many Unpowered Rockets

This exercise applies the concept of the invariant interval.

*   **Given:** Event 1: $(x_1, t_1) = (0, 0)$ and Event 2: $(x_2, t_2) = (6, 10)$. The spacetime interval is invariant between all frames.
    *   $\Delta s^2 = \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 = 10^2 - 6^2 = 100-36 = 64$

**(a) Rocket Frame A:**

*   Given $t'_2 = 14$ years, find $x'_2$:
    *   $14^2 - x_2'^2 = 64$. Thus,  $x_2'^2 = 196 - 64 = 132$.
    *   $x'_2 = \sqrt{132} \approx 11.49$ light-years

**(b) Rocket Frame B:**
*   Given $x''_2 = 5$ light-years, find $t''_2$:
    *   $t_2''^2 - 5^2 = 64$. Thus, $t_2''^2 = 64 + 25 = 89$
    *   $t''_2 = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43$ years

**(c) Rocket Frame C (Events occur at same place):**

*   $\Delta x_C = 0$. So, $\Delta t_C^2 = 64$
*   $t_C = \sqrt{64} = 8$ years
*   The rocket must be moving such that $\Delta x_C = 0$
*   We can calculate this velocity by recognizing that the interval is the time in the frame where the two events occur in the same place. So, in the lab frame, $\Delta x = 6$ and $\Delta t = 10$.
*   $v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ which is 60% of the speed of light.

**(d) Time between events in Rocket C:**

*   This is the interval, which we calculated is $t_C = 8$ years.

### Exercise 3-6: Down with Relativity!

This exercise addresses common objections to relativity.

**(a) "Clocks go slow" contradiction:**
*   The apparent contradiction arises from the fact that each observer uses their *own* frame to measure time intervals. Each observer sees the other's clock as running slow relative to their own. This is due to time dilation, a consequence of the geometry of spacetime, not a logical contradiction. The clocks do not "really" go slow, but time is a relative measurement that differs depending on frame of reference.

**(b) "Meter sticks are contracted" contradiction:**
*   Similarly, each observer uses their own frame to measure lengths. Each sees the other's meter sticks as contracted. This is due to length contraction, a real and measurable effect, not a contradiction. The meter sticks don't "really" shrink, but length is a relative measurement that differs depending on frame of reference.

**(c) "No unique way to define space and time coordinates":**
*   Relativity acknowledges that space and time coordinates are frame-dependent. However, physical laws and the spacetime interval are frame-independent. The fact that observers record different coordinates doesnâ€™t invalidate the theory, but rather reflects that space and time are relative. It is important to keep track of the frame you're working in.

**(d) "Light doesn't travel at a standard speed":**
*   The postulate of the constancy of the speed of light applies to the speed of light *in a vacuum* as measured by any inertial observer. This means that the measured speed of light is the same for all inertial observers regardless of their motion or the motion of the source of the light. Common sense intuition about the additive property of velocities does not apply to light.

**(e) "No experimental test":**
*   There are numerous experimental tests verifying relativity, such as particle accelerator experiments, atomic clock experiments, and the observation of muons at the Earthâ€™s surface.

**(f) "Relativity has no way to describe an event without coordinates":**
*   While relativity uses coordinates, the coordinates are just tools that describe where and when an event occurs. The physical reality of the event is independent of the coordinate system used to describe it. The interval between events is an example of this.

**(g) "Relativity is preoccupied with observation not reality":**
*   Relativity deals with how space and time are measured and related. The measurements are real and repeatable. These measurements reveal properties of space and time which are counterintuitive, and may not correspond with one's pre-relativity conception of reality, but the theory is a scientific theory.

### Exercise 3-7: Space War

*   **Looseness of Language:** The problem assumes a "snapshot" perspective where each observer can see the other's ship as a whole. It also assumes simultaneity when it is only valid for events that are at the same location as the observer (local simultaneity).
*   **Error in one figure:** The figure on the right is incorrect. In the frame of 0', 0' observes their own rocket at it's full proper length and measures the rocket of O to be contracted.
*   **Resolution:** The bullet will always hit in both frames of reference. In the frame of reference of observer O, the bullet is fired perpendicular to the rocket's motion and therefore hits the side of the other rocket. In the frame of reference of observer O', observer O' sees the rocket move past and the bullet as angled such that it will hit the rocket.
*   **Train Paradox Consistency:** This problem uses the same logic as the train paradox where the position and timing of events are relative and do not contradict each other but provide consistent results from different frames.

### Exercise 3-8: ÄŒerenkov Radiation

This exercise explores the phenomenon of ÄŒerenkov radiation.

**(a) Derivation of the Half-Angle Formula:**

*   The speed of light in the medium is $v_{\text{light}}$.
*   The speed of the particle is $v$.
*   During the time *t*, the particle travels $vt$. The light travels $v_{\text{light}}t$.
*   The light forms a cone with a half-angle $\phi$.
*   The cosine of this angle is:
    *   $\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}} t}{v t} = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v}$

**(b) Lucite:**

*   $v_{\text{light}} = \frac{2}{3}c$
    *   Minimum velocity for radiation: When $v = v_{\text{light}}$, radiation begins. Therefore, the minimum velocity is $v = \frac{2}{3}c$
    *   Maximum angle $\phi$:
        *   $\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v} = \frac{2/3c}{c} = \frac{2}{3}$
        *   $\phi = \arccos{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 48.2^{\circ}$

**(c) Water:**

*   $v_{\text{light}} = 0.75c$
    *   Minimum velocity for radiation: $v = 0.75c$
    *   Maximum angle $\phi$:
         *  $\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v} = \frac{0.75c}{c} = 0.75$
         * $\phi = \arccos(0.75) \approx 41.4^{\circ}$

### Exercise 3-9: Aberration of Starlight

This exercise examines how the Earthâ€™s motion affects the apparent position of stars.

**(a) Trigonometric Expression for Aberration Angle:**

*   $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}$

**(b) Evaluation:**

*   $v_{\text{Earth}} = 30 \times 10^3$ m/s
*   $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s
*   $\tan \psi = \frac{30 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-4}$
*   $\psi \approx 10^{-4} \text{ radians}$
*   To convert to seconds of arc:
    *   $1 \text{ radian} = \frac{180}{\pi} \text{ degrees}$
    *   $1 \text{ degree} = 3600 \text{ seconds of arc}$
    *   $\psi \approx 10^{-4} \times \frac{180}{\pi} \times 3600 \approx 20.6$ seconds of arc

**(c) Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic Answers:**

*   The non-relativistic answer is $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}$  which is the same as the relativistic answer in this case. The difference between the two is only important when the speeds are very large relative to the speed of light.
*    Because the speed of Earth is so much less than the speed of light, the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic answers is too small to be detected by experiments.

**(d) Rocket in Orbit:**

*   The direction of the star as seen by the rocket astronaut will be shifted due to aberration.
*  Let v' be the velocity of Earth and v be the new velocity of the rocket, where v = 0.5. Then $v_{combined} = \frac{v + v'}{1 + vv'}$
*   The new aberration angle will be greater because the speed of the rocket relative to the sun is greater than the speed of Earth relative to the Sun.
*    $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{combined}}{c}$

### Exercise 3-10: The Expanding Universe

This exercise looks at the consequences of an expanding universe.

**(a) Relative Motion of Fragments:**

*   Relative motion of fragments after a bomb explosion is that each fragment will move radially away from every other fragment. The farther away a fragment is, the faster it will appear to recede from the viewpoint of any other fragment.
*   **Detection:** The observer measures the time $\Delta t$ between flashes emitted at intervals $\Delta \tau$. Due to time dilation, $\Delta t$ is larger than $\Delta \tau$.
*   The velocity can be obtained by recognizing that if the fragment is moving away, the next light pulse will take longer to arrive, but if the fragment is moving towards, it will arrive sooner.
    *  $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta \tau}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}$
    *   $v = \sqrt{1 - (\frac{\Delta \tau}{\Delta t})^2}$
*   **Recession Velocity:** The recession velocity increases with distance, because the expansion of space is uniform.

**(b) Verification using Starlight:**

*   The spectral lines of light emitted by stars are shifted to lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) if they are moving away from us. This "redshift" allows us to measure the recession velocity of stars and galaxies.

**(c) Quasar Redshift:**

*   Given $\frac{\Delta t_{\text{reception}}}{\Delta \tau} = 5.9$, find $v$
*   Using the formula derived in part (a), we have:
    *  $v = \sqrt{1 - (\frac{1}{5.9})^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{34.81}} \approx \sqrt{0.971} \approx 0.985$
    *   Thus, the quasar's recession velocity is approximately $0.985c$.

### Exercise 3-11: Law of Addition of Velocities

This exercise derives the relativistic law of velocity addition.

**(a) Earth Frame Analysis**

*   Let the space bus have length $L$ and velocity $V_{\text{rel}}$. Let the speed of the bullet be $V_{\text{bullet}}$.

*   Time to reach front of bus in the earth frame is $t_{\text{forward}}$. In this time, the light travels the length of the bus plus the distance the bus travels:
    *   $t_{\text{forward}} = L + V_{\text{rel}}t_{\text{forward}}$

*   $t_{\text{forward}}(1-V_{\text{rel}}) = L $
*   $t_{\text{forward}} = \frac{L}{1-V_{\text{rel}}}$
*   Time for bullet to reach front is $t_b$. In the same way, we have:
    * $V_{\text{bullet}} t_b =  L + V_{\text{rel}}t_b $
    * $t_b = \frac{L}{V_{\text{bullet}} - V_{\text{rel}}}$

**(b) Light Flash Race**
*   Time for the light flash to reach the front: $t_{\text{forward}}$
    *   $t_{\text{forward}} = \frac{L}{1-V_{\text{rel}}}$
*   Time for the light flash to reach the back: $t_{\text{backward}}$
    *   $t_{\text{backward}} = \frac{L}{1+V_{\text{rel}}}$

**(c) Fraction of the Bus**
*   Let $f$ be the fractional distance of Fred's position relative to the front of the bus as measured from Earth when the flash reaches the back of the bus. We can set this up as:
    *   $f = \frac{V_{\text{bullet}} \frac{L}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}}{\frac{L}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}} + \frac{L}{1+V_{\text{rel}}}} = \frac{V_{\text{bullet}} (1+V_{\text{rel}})}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}} + 1 + V_{\text{rel}}}$

*   This becomes:

    *   $\frac{t_{\text{forward}}}{t_{\text{backward}}} =  \frac{1+V_{\text{rel}}}{1-V_{\text{rel}}}$
   *   $\frac{t_{\text{forward}}}{t_{\text{bullet}}} =  \frac{V_{\text{bullet}}-V_{\text{rel}}}{1-V_{\text{rel}}}$
   *   $\frac{t_{\text{bullet}}}{t_{\text{backward}}} = \frac{1+V_{\text{rel}}}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}$
    *  $\frac{t_{\text{bullet}}}{t_{\text{backward}}} = \frac{1+V_{\text{rel}}}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}$
*   $\frac{t_{\text{forward}}}{t_{\text{backward}}} \frac{t_{\text{bullet}}}{t_{\text{forward}}} = \frac{t_{\text{bullet}}}{t_{\text{backward}}}$
    *   $\frac{1+V_{\text{rel}}}{1-V_{\text{rel}}} \frac{V_{\text{bullet}} -V_{\text{rel}}}{1-V_{\text{rel}}} = \frac{1+V_{\text{rel}}}{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}$
    *   $\frac{V_{\text{bullet}}-V_{\text{rel}}}{1-V_{\text{rel}}} = \frac{V_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + V_{\text{rel}}}$

   * $\frac{1 - V_{\text{bullet}}}{1 + V_{\text{bullet}}} = \frac{1 - V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + V_{\text{rel}}}$

**(d) Result for the Earth Frame**
 * $(1-V_{\text{bullet}})(1 + V_{\text{rel}}) = (1+V_{\text{bullet}})(1-V_{\text{rel}})$

**(e) Space Bus Frame Analysis**
*   In the bus frame, $V_{\text{rel}} = 0$, and $V_{\text{bullet}}$ becomes $V'_{\text{bullet}}$
   *  $\frac{1 - V'_{\text{bullet}}}{1 + V'_{\text{bullet}}}$

**(f) Law of Addition of Velocities**
   *  $\frac{1 - V_{\text{bullet}}}{1 + V_{\text{bullet}}} = \frac{1 - V'_{\text{bullet}}}{1 + V'_{\text{bullet}}}$

    *   $V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{V'_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + V'_{\text{bullet}}V_{\text{rel}}}$

**(g) Consequences**

*   **(1) Everyday Speeds:**
    *   $V_{\text{rel}} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-7}$
    *  $V'_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{600}{3 \times 10^8} = 2 \times 10^{-6}$
   *    $V'_{\text{bullet}}V_{\text{rel}} = 2 \times 10^{-13}$

     The denominator becomes approximately 1.  The formula reduces to $V_{\text{bullet}} = V'_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}$ which is what you would expect from normal experiences.
*   **(2) Bullet and Spacebus at 3/4 c:**
     *   $V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4}}{1 + (\frac{3}{4})^2} = \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \frac{9}{16}} = \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{\frac{25}{16}} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{16}{25} = \frac{24}{25}c$
    *  $V_{\text{bullet}} = 0.96c$
*   **(3) Light Flash as a bullet:**
    *   $V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{1 + \frac{3}{4}}{1 + \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\frac{7}{4}}{\frac{7}{4}} = 1$
        The velocity is the speed of light as measured by earth.
*   **(4) Light flash emitted from front of bus towards back:**
     * $V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{-1 + \frac{3}{4}}{1 + (-1)(\frac{3}{4})} = \frac{-\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} = -1$
       The velocity is the speed of light as measured by earth in the opposite direction.

### Exercise 3-12: Michelson-Morley Experiment

This exercise analyzes the Michelson-Morley experiment and related concepts.

**(a) Airplane with Wind (Round Trip along Wind):**

*   Time against the wind:  $t_1 = \frac{L}{c-v}$
*   Time with the wind:  $t_2 = \frac{L}{c+v}$
*   Total time:  $t = t_1+ t_2 = \frac{L}{c-v} + \frac{L}{c+v} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2-v^2} = \frac{2L}{c(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})}$
*  The round trip time is $t =  \frac{2L}{c}$. The effect of wind is that this gets modified by a factor of $\frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$.
*   **Paradox:** The wind adds to the airplane's speed in one direction but decreases it by the same amount in the opposite direction. The difference is because of the time, so even though the distances are the same, one leg of the trip takes longer and therefore is weighted more heavily.

**(b) Airplane with Wind (Round Trip Perpendicular to Wind):**

*   The airplane must fly at an angle to compensate for the wind
* The distance traveled in each direction is $\frac{L}{\cos \theta}$, where $\sin \theta = \frac{v}{c}$.
* $\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$. Thus, the distance is $\frac{L}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
*   The total trip distance is  $\frac{2L}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$. The total trip time is $\frac{2L}{c\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.
*   The time is greater by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.

**(c) Arrival Time Difference:**

*   Time difference $\Delta t$ between the two planes is
    *   $\frac{2L}{c(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})} - \frac{2L}{c\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
*   Using the binomial theorem we have:
     *  $(1-z)^n \approx 1 -nz$ for $z<<1$.

   *   $\frac{1}{(1-z)} \approx 1+z$
*   $\frac{2L}{c}(1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}) - \frac{2L}{c}(1+\frac{v^2}{2c^2})$
*   $\frac{2L}{c}\frac{v^2}{2c^2} = \frac{Lv^2}{c^3}$
*  $dt = \frac{L}{2c}(\frac{v}{c})^2$

**(d) South Pole Air Station:**

*    $\Delta t = 4$ seconds
*  We can calculate the round trip distance $L$ to the research huts as twice the distance of the radius of the circle.  So $L = 2 \times 300km = 600km$.  We can also express this in meters as $6 \times 10^5$ meters.
*  The air speed is $c=300km/hr = 300 \times \frac{10^3}{3600} = 83.33$ m/s.
*  We have the formula:
   * $\Delta t = \frac{L}{2c}(\frac{v}{c})^2$
   *  $4 = \frac{6 \times 10^5}{2 \times 83.33}(\frac{v}{83.33})^2$
   *   $4 = 3600 (\frac{v}{83.33})^2$
   *   $0.0011 = (\frac{v}{83.33})^2$
   *   $v \approx 2.8$ m/s
*   The wind direction can't be determined exactly, but it must have a component parallel to the direction of the planes with a speed of approximately 2.8 m/s

**(e) Michelson-Morley Time Difference:**

*   $L = 22 \text{ meters}$
*   $v = 30 \times 10^3 \text{ m/s}$
*   $c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$
* Using the approximation for $v << c$ we have:

*   $\Delta t = \frac{L}{c}(\frac{v}{c})^2 = \frac{22}{3 \times 10^8}(\frac{30 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8})^2 =  \frac{22}{3 \times 10^8}(\frac{9 \times 10^8}{9 \times 10^{16}}) \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-15}$ seconds.

**(f) Interferometer and Sodium Light:**

*  $ \lambda = 589 \times 10^{-9} \text{ meters}$
*  $f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{589 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{14} Hz$
    *   $T = \frac{1}{f} \approx 1.96 \times 10^{-15}$ seconds
*   A shift of one fringe (from bright to dark to bright) requires a time difference of one period, approximately $2 \times 10^{-15}$ seconds.
*   They found a shift less than $\frac{1}{100}$ of a fringe and a time difference of $\frac{1}{100}$ of $2 \times 10^{-15} = 2 \times 10^{-17}$.
*  The time change from part e was $\Delta t = 2.2 \times 10^{-15}$
* If the ether existed, we would expect a time change of $2 \times \Delta t = 4.4 \times 10^{-15}$ which is approximately 220 times larger than what was measured.
*  This means the measured ether drift is less than $220 \times  \frac{1}{100} = \frac{1}{5.5} $ of what we expect based on Earth's speed.
*   Therefore, the ether drift, if it exists, is less than $\frac{30 \times 10^3}{5.5}  \approx  5400 m/s$. This is approximately $\frac{1}{6}$ of Earth's orbital speed.

**(g) Discussion on Ether Theory**

*   The Michelson-Morley experiment by itself does not completely disprove ether theory but it shows the ether does not affect the speed of light.
*   The ether theory can be modified to agree with the results by proposing that the ether is somehow dragged along with the Earth.
*   However, this modified theory would not be able to explain the observed stellar aberration or the results of experiments that do not rely on the motion of the Earth as a whole, so additional experiments are needed.

### Exercise 3-13: The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment

This exercise explores the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment.

**(a) Time Difference between Arms**

*   The difference in length between the arms is $l$.
*   The time difference is $\frac{2l}{c}$

*   For $l = 16 \text{ cm} = 0.16 \text{ m}$:
    *  $ \Delta t = \frac{2 \times 0.16 \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 1.06 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}$

**(b) Number of Periods**

*   $T = 1.820 \times 10^{-15}$ seconds
*   $n = \frac{\Delta t}{T} = \frac{1.06 \times 10^{-9}}{1.820 \times 10^{-15}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^5 \text{ periods}$

**(c) Implications of No Fringe Shift**

*   If no fringe shift is observed, then $n$ is constant. The equation is $c = \frac{2l}{nT}$. All terms in this equation need to be constant for this to occur.
* The standards are:
 * *Distance*  is measured by the quartz in the apparatus.
 * *Time* is measured by the period of the light source.
*   The equation reveals that if there is no shift it implies c remains the same between frames.

**(d) Differential of the Equation**
*   We take the differential of $c = \frac{2l}{nT}$ as follows:

   * $dc = \frac{d(2l)}{nT} - \frac{2l}{n^2 T}dn$
  *   $ \frac{dc}{c} = \frac{dl}{l} - \frac{dn}{n}$

*   Given $\frac{dn}{n} < \frac{3}{1000}$, then $\frac{dc}{c} < \frac{3}{1000}$ if we assume $\frac{dl}{l}$ is negligible since the materials are very stable.
*   Historical Note:
    *   Theory A (length contraction only) is ruled out.
   *   Theory B (length and time contraction) is consistent, as is the simpler Einstein theory (no ether, consistent with the principle of relativity).

### Exercise 3-14: Things That Move Faster Than Light

This exercise looks at examples that appear to violate the speed of light.

**(a) The Scissors Paradox:**

*  $V_A = \frac{V_{rod}}{\sin\theta}$
*   Yes, if $\sin\theta < V_{rod}$ then $V_A > c$. This occurs when $\theta$ is very small.
*  No, this cannot be used to transmit a message faster than light. The intersection point is not a physical object, and does not carry information.

**(b) Transmission of a Hammer Pulse:**

*   No, this cannot transmit a message faster than light. Although the intersection point of the rod moves faster, there is no information being transmitted as this is just a visual effect, not the movement of a physical thing.

**(c) Searchlight Messenger?**
*  No. While the searchlight beam can sweep from A to B faster than a light signal, no *information* travels from A to B faster than light. A and B are simply receiving light, not a signal.

**(d) Oscilloscope Writing Speed:**

*   No actual physical object is moving across the screen. The writing speed is the speed at which the spot appears, the electrons themselves are not moving faster than light.

### Exercise 3-15: Four Times the Speed of Light?

This exercise examines apparent speeds in relativity.

**(a) Apparent Speed of Approaching Rocket:**

*   **Distance between images:** Let the distance the rocket moves be $x$.

*   **Time between reception:** $\Delta t_{rec} = t_2 - t_1$. The distance traveled by the light must be equal to $x$. Therefore, the time difference is related to the time the rocket travels between positions and the time it takes light to travel.  Let the time the rocket travels be $T$.  Then the distance traveled is $vT$ which is equal to $x$.
 * $t_2 - t_1 = T + \frac{vT}{c}$.
*  $\Delta t_{rec} = T(1+\frac{v}{c})$
*   **Apparent speed:** $v_{\text{app}} = \frac{vT}{T(1 + \frac{v}{c})} = \frac{v}{1 - v}$

*   Given $v_{\text{app}} = 4c$, solve for $v$. $v = \frac{4}{5}c$
* Given $v_{\text{app}} = 99c$, solve for $v$. $v = \frac{99}{100}c$

**(b) Apparent Speed of Receding Rocket:**

*    $\Delta t_{rec} = t_2 - t_1 = T - \frac{vT}{c} = T(1-\frac{v}{c})$.
*   **Apparent speed:** $v
