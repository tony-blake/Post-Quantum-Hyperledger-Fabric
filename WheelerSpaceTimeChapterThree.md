Okay, here's a detailed scientific summary for each section in Chapter 3, drawing on the provided sources, using a mixture of markdown, LaTeX, and HTML formatting, and incorporating bold text for emphasis, as requested. Numerical and mathematical examples are provided to illustrate the concepts.

### 3.1 The Principle of Relativity

*   This section introduces the **Principle of Relativity**, which states that **all the laws of physics are the same in every free-float (inertial) reference frame**.
*   It begins with everyday examples, such as being in a car or airplane, to demonstrate that without looking outside, one cannot tell if they are moving or at rest.
*   **Galileo's thought experiment** with a ship is used to illustrate the principle. He describes how observations within a uniformly moving ship are identical to those in a stationary ship. This demonstrates that relative uniform motion does not affect the laws of physics.
*   The principle is extended from ships to unpowered spaceships to better illustrate **free-float frames**.
*   The section emphasizes that **no test of the laws of physics provides any way whatsoever to distinguish one free-float frame from another**.
*   The **Principle of Relativity rests on emptiness**, meaning space itself has no preferred reference frame, allowing different observers to use their own latticeworks of clocks and rods without conflict.

    *   While modern physics acknowledges that space is not truly empty, the principle applies in regions of spacetime that are effectively empty.

### 3.2 What is Not the Same in Different Frames

*   This section focuses on the quantities that are **not the same** when measured from different inertial frames.
*   It emphasizes that **space and time separations** are generally not the same in different frames.
*   **Velocities, accelerations, forces, and electric and magnetic fields** also differ when measured in different frames.
*   For example, a sparkplug's velocity will be measured differently by an observer in the laboratory frame versus an observer in a rocket frame.
*   The section also explains that the **speed of light** is a conversion factor between units of space and time, rather than a fundamental constant.
*   A **meter** is now defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.
    *   This means that the value of the speed of light is fixed by decree at 299,792,458 m/s.
*  **The speed of light is the same for all observers**, though they will disagree on time and space intervals.

### 3.3 What is the Same in Different Frames

*   Despite the differences, the **laws of physics** are the same in all inertial frames.
*  For example, the relation between **force and acceleration** is the same in both a laboratory frame and a rocket frame, though the numerical values of the force and acceleration may differ.
*   **Fundamental physical constants**, such as the elementary charge on an electron and the speed of light, also remain the same in all inertial frames.
*   The value of the speed of light must be the same in overlapping free-float frames, otherwise these frames could be distinguished from one another and the Principle of Relativity violated.
*  The **numerical value of the speed of light** has been established by decree, underscoring its role as a conversion factor between units of space and time.
*   **Sample Problem 3-1** gives examples of quantities that are the same (speed of light, order of elements) and quantities that are not (speed of an electron, time between two events).

### 3.6 Invariance of Transverse Dimension

*   This section addresses whether a moving object is measured to get thinner as well as shorter as it moves faster and faster.
*   It concludes that **high speed has no measurable effect on transverse dimensions**. There is no observed thinning or fattening of fast objects.
*   Thought experiments, such as the **Speeding-Train** and **Speeding-Pipes**, demonstrate this.
    *   If transverse dimensions changed, the wheels of a train might slip off the tracks, and pipes might pass inside each other in different reference frames.
*  The **invariance of transverse dimensions** also applies to events; two events with separation only transverse to the direction of relative motion and simultaneous in one frame, are also simultaneous in all frames.

### 3.7 Invariance of the Interval Proved

*   This section demonstrates a key consequence of the Principle of Relativity: the **invariance of the spacetime interval**.
*   The spacetime interval is defined as the square of the time separation minus the square of the space separation between two events: $$\text{interval}^2 = (\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2$$.
*   A thought experiment is used in which a light flash is emitted from a rocket, travels to a mirror, and then is reflected back to a detector on the rocket.
    *   In the **rocket frame**, the space separation between the emission and reception of the light is zero, and the time separation is 6 meters of light-travel time, giving an interval of 6 meters.
*   In the **laboratory frame**, the rocket moves during the round trip of the light, so the light travels a longer, slanted path. The light travels 10 meters of light-travel time.
    *   Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the light path, the space separation is calculated as 8 meters, and the time separation is 10 meters.
    *   The interval is calculated as: $$\text{interval}^2 = (10 \text{ meters})^2 - (8 \text{ meters})^2 = 100 - 64 = 36 \text{ meters}^2$$, which means the interval is 6 meters in this example.
*   **Table 3-1** summarizes the different measurements of space and time in rocket and laboratory frames, yet shows how they result in the same spacetime interval.
*   The interval is invariant, meaning that it has the same value for all observers in inertial frames, despite disagreements about space and time separations individually.
*   The invariance of the interval is a central result of special relativity, demonstrating that there is no absolute time difference between two events.

### 3.9 Summary

*   This section summarizes the key concepts of the chapter, emphasizing that **the laws of physics are the same in every inertial (free-float) reference frame**.
*   It reiterates several consequences of the Principle of Relativity:
    *   **Relativity of simultaneity:** Events simultaneous in one frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another frame if they are separated in the direction of motion.
    *   **Lorentz contraction:** An object in high-speed motion is measured to be shorter along its direction of motion than its proper length (measured in its rest frame).
    *   **Invariance of transverse distances:** Dimensions of moving objects perpendicular to the motion are measured to be the same in different frames.
    *   **Simultaneity of transverse events:** Events with separation only transverse to the motion that are simultaneous in one frame are also simultaneous in all frames.
*   The chapter concludes by noting that the **rocket time can be very much smaller than the laboratory time** as the rocket approaches the speed of light. This means that in principle, one can go to any remote star in a short time, despite speed limits.
*   The text stresses that while our speed is limited by the speed of light, the distance we can travel is unlimited.
*   **The invariance of the interval is based on the principle of relativity** and is due to both invariance of transverse distance and invariance of the speed of light.

### Other Key Concepts from Exercises

*   **Sample Problem 3-2, the K+ Meson:** The half-life of a particle in its own rest frame can be calculated by measuring the decay rate in a laboratory frame and using the invariant interval.
    *   For example, if a beam of K+ mesons travels 9 meters and only one quarter of them survive, this corresponds to two half-lives.
*   **Relativity and Swimming (Exercise 3-1):**  A swimmer takes different amounts of time to swim a distance with and against a current; this is different than the case of light, whose speed is always the same relative to all observers.
*   **Einstein Puzzler (Exercise 3-2):** A runner will always see herself in the mirror, even at speeds close to the speed of light.
*  **Construction of Clocks (Exercise 3-3):** All clocks will run at the same rate relative to one another within a free-float frame, even when that rate is different when measured from another free-float frame.
*   **Principle of Relativity (Exercise 3-4):** Quantities like the spacetime interval and the structure of DNA are the same in overlapping free-float frames, but things like the kinetic energy of an electron and the magnetic field at a point are not.
*   **Down with Relativity! (Exercise 3-6):** Presents objections to relativity and then answers them, highlighting that the theory is logical and self-consistent.
*   **Cerenkov Radiation (Exercise 3-8):** Explores Cerenkov radiation, which is emitted when particles travel faster than light in a medium, showing that the angle of the light cone is related to the particle's speed in that medium: $$\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v}$$,.
    *   For example, the minimum velocity for Cerenkov radiation in Lucite is 2/3 the speed of light and in water, the minimum is 0.75 the speed of light.
*   **Aberration of Starlight (Exercise 3-9):**  The apparent direction of starlight changes due to the motion of the observer, and the aberration angle can be calculated using trigonometry.
    *   The angle of aberration can be calculated as $$\tan \psi = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}$$, and Earth's motion causes an apparent shift of about 20.5 seconds of arc.
*   **The Expanding Universe (Exercise 3-10):** Observation of light from stars can be used to verify the expansion of the universe by analyzing the red shift of the light using the Doppler effect.
    *   The recession velocity of stars can be determined by comparing observed and proper periods of spectral lines.
    *   For example, a quasar with a redshift of 5.9 has a velocity of 0.94 the speed of light.
*  **Law of Addition of Velocities (Exercise 3-11):** Two speeds cannot simply be added together; relativistic addition of velocities is given by: $$V_{\text{combined}} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}$$.
    *  When dealing with everyday speeds, the equation simplifies to the simple addition of velocities.
*  **Michelson-Morley Experiment (Exercise 3-12):** This experiment failed to detect the motion of Earth through the "ether".
    *   The time difference between light traveling in perpendicular directions is extremely small, but the use of interference allows it to be observed, and the results of the experiment are explained by the fact that the speed of light is constant in every inertial frame.
*  **The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment (Exercise 3-13):** This experiment tested the isotropy of the speed of light and measured the change in interference patterns between paths of unequal length due to motion.
    *   The results of the experiment are consistent with the speed of light being the same in all inertial frames and that a clock's frequency is not affected by the velocity.
*  **Things That Move Faster Than Light (Exercise 3-14):** Objects such as the point of intersection of a long rod and the axis along which the rod moves can move faster than light, but these cannot be used to transmit information faster than light.
* **Four Times the Speed of Light? (Exercise 3-15):** An approaching rocket can appear to move faster than the speed of light due to the way that we receive light from the rocket as it moves, while a receding rocket will never appear to move away at more than half the speed of light.
*   **Superluminal Expansion of Quasar 3C273? (Exercise 3-16):** The apparent speed of separation of parts of a quasar can be greater than the speed of light due to the geometry of how the light reaches the observer from a source moving at relativistic speeds.
    *   The apparent time separation is given by: $$\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = \Delta t \left(1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos\theta\right)$$, and the apparent transverse speed is given by: $$v_{\text{seen, max}} = \frac{v}{1 - v^2}$$.
* **Contraction or Rotation (Exercise 3-17):** Explores how a moving cube will be seen with the eye versus how it will be measured by a latticework of clocks. The cube will appear rotated due to the time it takes for light from different points to reach the viewer, with the angle of rotation being given by: $$\tan \phi = v$$, where v is the velocity of the cube in the laboratory frame.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and examples discussed in Chapter 3 of the source material.


Okay, here are the detailed numerical and mathematical solutions to all exercises in Chapter 3, using a mixture of markdown, LaTeX, and HTML formatting, incorporating bold text for emphasis, and using bullet points for clarity.

### Exercise 3-1: Relativity and Swimming

*   **(a)** Time for a swimmer to swim down and back a 30-meter pool:
    *   Distance = 2 * 30 meters = 60 meters
    *   Speed = 1 meter/second
    *   Time = Distance / Speed = 60 meters / (1 meter/second) = **60 seconds**

*   **(b)** Time for a swimmer to swim between two floats moving at 1/3 m/s, 30 meters apart
    *   **Downstream:**
        *   Swimmer's speed relative to floats = 1 m/s - 1/3 m/s = 2/3 m/s
        *   Distance = 30 meters
        *   Time downstream = 30 meters / (2/3 m/s) = 45 seconds
    *   **Upstream:**
        *   Swimmer's speed relative to floats = 1 m/s + 1/3 m/s = 4/3 m/s
        *   Distance = 30 meters
        *   Time upstream = 30 meters / (4/3 m/s) = 22.5 seconds
    *   Total time = 45 seconds + 22.5 seconds = **67.5 seconds**

*   **(c)** No, the total time from A to B and back again is **not independent** of the reference system. The time is different for the stationary pool and the moving floats.

*   **(d)** Difference between swimmer and light flash:
    *   For the **swimmer**, the speed relative to the medium (water) is constant, but the speed relative to the floats depends on whether the swimmer is moving with or against the float's motion. The total time for the round trip also depends on the motion of the floats.
    *   For the **light flash**, the speed is always the same (c) in all free-float frames and the time to complete the round trip is independent of the motion of the spaceship.

### Exercise 3-2: Einstein Puzzler

*   According to the Principle of Relativity, the runner will be able to see herself in the mirror, no matter how fast she is running. In the runner's frame, she is at rest, and everything works as it does when she is standing still. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.

### Exercise 3-3: Construction of Clocks

*   If all clocks are adjusted to run at the same rate at rest in the lab, then the free-float rocket observer will measure them all to run at the same rate. This is because the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. However, the (common) clock rate of these clocks measured by the rocket observer will not be the same as their (common) rate measured by the laboratory observer as they pass by in the rocket. This is because time intervals are not invariant.

### Exercise 3-4: The Principle of Relativity

*   **(a)** Time it takes for light to go one meter of distance in a vacuum: **yes** (speed of light is constant)
*   **(b)** Spacetime interval between two events: **yes** (invariant quantity)
*   **(c)** Kinetic energy of an electron: **no**
*   **(d)** Value of the mass of the electron: **yes** (fundamental constant)
*   **(e)** Value of the magnetic field at a given point: **no**
*   **(f)** Distance between two events: **no**
*   **(g)** Structure of the DNA molecule: **yes** (laws of physics are the same)
*   **(h)** Time rate of change of momentum of a neutron: **no** (force is not invariant)

### Exercise 3-5: Many Unpowered Rockets

*   Given:
    *   Event 1: x = 0 light-years, t = 0 years
    *   Event 2: x = 6 light-years, t = 10 years
    *   In all rocket frames, event 1 occurs at x' = 0, t' = 0
*   **(a)** In rocket frame A, event 2 occurs at t' = 14 years.
    *   We use the invariance of the spacetime interval:
        *   (t')<sup>2</sup> - (x')<sup>2</sup> = t<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>
        *   14<sup>2</sup> - (x')<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>2</sup> - 6<sup>2</sup>
        *   196 - (x')<sup>2</sup> = 100 - 36
        *   (x')<sup>2</sup> = 196 - 64 = 132
        *   x' = &plusmn;√132 ≈ **&plusmn;11.49 light-years**
*   **(b)** In rocket frame B, event 2 occurs at x'' = 5 light-years.
    *    Using the invariance of the spacetime interval:
        *   (t'')<sup>2</sup> - (x'')<sup>2</sup> = t<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>
        *   (t'')<sup>2</sup> - 5<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>2</sup> - 6<sup>2</sup>
        *   (t'')<sup>2</sup> - 25 = 100 - 36
        *   (t'')<sup>2</sup> = 89
        *   t'' = &plusmn;√89 ≈ **&plusmn;9.43 years**
*   **(c)**  For events 1 and 2 to occur at the same place in rocket frame C, the spacetime interval must be zero:
    *   t<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = 0
    *   t<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup>
    *  This implies that the speed of light is equal to the speed of the rocket (x/t = 1) or:
    *   v = x/t = 6/10 = 0.6
    *   The rocket frame must move at **0.6c**.
*   **(d)**  The time between events 1 and 2 in frame C is:
    *   (t')<sup>2</sup> - (x')<sup>2</sup> = t<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>
    *   (t')<sup>2</sup> - 0 = 10<sup>2</sup> - 6<sup>2</sup> = 64
    *   t' = &plusmn; √64 =  **&plusmn;8 years**

### Exercise 3-6: Down with Relativity!

*   **(a)** "Observer A says that B's clock goes slow, and observer B says that A's clock goes slow. This is a logical contradiction."
    *   There is **no contradiction**. Each observer measures the other's clock to be running slow **relative to their own**. This is due to the relativity of simultaneity and time dilation. There is no absolute time, and each observer's measurements are valid in their own frame.
*   **(b)** "Observer A says that B's meter sticks are contracted, and observer B says that A's meter sticks are contracted. This is a logical contradiction."
    *   There is **no contradiction**. Each observer measures the other's meter sticks to be contracted in the direction of relative motion, **relative to their own meter sticks**. This is due to Lorentz contraction and is a consequence of how space and time measurements change between frames.
*   **(c)** "Relativity does not have a unique way to define space and time coordinates for the instantaneous position of an object."
    *   Relativity acknowledges that space and time coordinates are **relative to the observer's frame**. Different observers will record different coordinates for the same event, but there is no single "correct" frame. The laws of physics remain consistent in all inertial frames. The spacetime interval is invariant.
*   **(d)** "Relativity postulates that light travels with a standard speed regardless of the free-float frame. This is wrong."
    *   The postulate that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames is the **foundation of relativity**. It is supported by experimental evidence and has been verified in numerous experiments. Common sense can be misleading when dealing with relativistic speeds.
*  **(e)** "There isn't a single experimental test of the results of special relativity."
    *   This is **incorrect.** There have been **many experimental tests** confirming the results of special relativity. These experiments are often performed at particle accelerators.
*   **(f)** "Relativity offers no way to describe an event without coordinates."
    *   While coordinates are useful for describing events within a specific frame, relativity also has an invariant way to describe events by their spacetime interval. Physical events exist independently of the coordinates that we use to describe them.
*   **(g)** "Relativity is preoccupied with how we observe things, not what is really happening."
    *   Relativity deals with **measurements** that observers make, but these measurements describe "what really happens" in each observer's frame. The theory is about the relationships between measurements in different inertial frames, not about observation as a subjective experience.

### Exercise 3-7: Space War

*   The problem states that the language is loose and there is an error in the figure. In this case the error is that the drawing makes it seem like the two rockets have a relative velocity, when in fact they are moving at the same velocity and thus *at rest* relative to one another. The problem also states that the gun is fired at the moment that the points a and a' coincide.

* The correct approach is to consider both the frames and to recognize that they are equivalent, there is no preferred frame. In either frame, the bullet is fired perpendicular to the axis of the relative motion, there will be no length contraction for the bullet in the direction perpendicular to the direction of relative motion.
    *   From the perspective of either observer, **the bullet will hit** the other rocket.
    *   The error is in assuming that a transverse contraction occurs for either rocket.

### Exercise 3-8: Cerenkov Radiation

*   **(a)** Derivation of the half-angle of the light cone
    *   From the geometry of the cone, cos φ =  V<sub>light</sub>/v, where V<sub>light</sub> is the speed of light in the medium, and v is the speed of the particle.
*   **(b)** Lucite (V<sub>light</sub> = 2/3)
    *   Minimum velocity of the particle for Cerenkov radiation:
        *   cos φ < 1, so V<sub>light</sub>/v < 1
        *   v > V<sub>light</sub>
        *   v > 2/3
        *   Therefore, the minimum speed is **v > 2/3c**
    *   Maximum angle of Cerenkov radiation:
        *   cos φ = 2/3
        *   φ = cos<sup>-1</sup> (2/3) ≈ **48.2 degrees**
*   **(c)** Water (V<sub>light</sub> = 0.75)
    *    Minimum velocity of the particle:
        *    v > V<sub>light</sub>
        *    v > 0.75
        *   The minimum speed is **v > 0.75c**
    *   Maximum angle of Cerenkov radiation:
        *   cos φ = 0.75
        *   φ = cos<sup>-1</sup>(0.75) ≈ **41.4 degrees**

### Exercise 3-9: Aberration of Starlight

*   **(a)** Trigonometric expression for aberration angle ψ
    *   tan ψ = v<sub>Earth</sub> / c
*   **(b)** Evaluate the expression for v<sub>Earth</sub> = 30 km/s
    *   tan ψ = (30 * 10<sup>3</sup> m/s) / (3 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/s) = 10<sup>-4</sup>
    *   ψ = arctan(10<sup>-4</sup>) ≈ 10<sup>-4</sup> radians
    *   To convert to seconds of arc:
        *   1 radian = (180/π) degrees
        *   1 degree = 3600 seconds of arc
        *   ψ ≈ 10<sup>-4</sup> * (180/π) * 3600 ≈ **20.6 seconds of arc**
*   **(c)** Is the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic answers a crucial experiment?
    *   The non-relativistic answer, tan ψ = v<sub>Earth</sub> / c, is approximately the same as the relativistic one for small angles, therefore it is **not** a crucial experiment for deciding between the two theories.
*   **(d)** Rocket changes velocity to v = 0.5c
    *   The astronaut will see the star at a different angle, according to the formula tan ψ' = v<sub>rocket</sub> / c
    *   The new angle can be found using the relativistic addition of velocities.

### Exercise 3-10: The Expanding Universe

*   **(a)** Motion of one fragment relative to another in an explosion
    *   The fragments move radially away from each other.
    *   Detection of relative motion: Observe the time between light flashes emitted by the other fragment.
    *   Formula for v:
        *   v = c * (dt/dτ -1)/(dt/dτ + 1)
*   **(b)** How to verify the expansion of the universe from starlight
    *   The observed period of light from stars is measured on Earth. The atoms in stars emit light at characteristic frequencies.
    *   When the emitting source is moving away from an observer, the observed period is longer (lower frequency) compared to the period when the source is at rest relative to the observer (redshift).
    *   The redshift of light from distant galaxies indicates that they are moving away from us, indicating an expanding universe.
*   **(c)** Recession velocity of a quasar with redshift dtreception /d! = 5.9.
    *   Using the equation:
        *   v = c * (5.9-1)/(5.9+1)
        *   v = c * 4.9/6.9
        *   v ≈ **0.71c**

### Exercise 3-11: Law of Addition of Velocities

*   **(a)** Distance traveled by light flash in Earth frame
    *   Distance = L + v<sub>rel</sub> * t<sub>forward</sub>
    *   t<sub>forward</sub> = L / (1 - v<sub>rel</sub>)
    *   Therefore L + v<sub>rel</sub> *  ( L / (1 - v<sub>rel</sub>) ) = L * (1 + v<sub>rel</sub>) / (1 - v<sub>rel</sub>)
*   **(b)** Time for light flash to reach the back of the bus in Earth frame
    *   t<sub>backward</sub>  = L / (1 + v<sub>rel</sub>)
*  **(c)** Ratio of the distance to Fred and the total bus length:
    *   f = L<sub>Fred</sub> / L
    *   f = (1 - v<sub>bullet</sub> )/(1 + v<sub>bullet</sub>) * (1 + v<sub>rel</sub>) /(1 - v<sub>rel</sub>)
*  **(d)** Combined expression:

    *   (1 - v<sub>bullet</sub>)  (1 + v<sub>rel</sub>) = (1 + v<sub>bullet</sub>) (1 - v<sub>rel</sub>)
*   **(e)**  Result for the spacebus frame:
    *   (1 - v'<sub>bullet</sub>)  = (1 + v'<sub>bullet</sub>)
*   **(f)** Law of addition of velocities:
    *   Equating expressions for f and solving for v<sub>bullet</sub>
    *    v<sub>bullet</sub> =  (v'<sub>bullet</sub> + v<sub>rel</sub> ) / ( 1 +  v'<sub>bullet</sub> * v<sub>rel</sub>)
*   **(g)** Consequences
    *  **(1)**  Express bus on Earth:
        *  v<sub>rel</sub> = 30 m/s , v'<sub>bullet</sub> = 600 m/s.
        *  v<sub>rel</sub> ≈ 10<sup>-7</sup> , v'<sub>bullet</sub> ≈ 10<sup>-6</sup> in units of c.
        *  v'<sub>bullet</sub> * v<sub>rel</sub> is approximately 10<sup>-13</sup>, which is negligible.
        *  v<sub>bullet</sub> ≈ v'<sub>bullet</sub> + v<sub>rel</sub> (approximate Galilean form)
    *   **(2)** Bullet and spacebus: v'<sub>bullet</sub> = 3/4, v<sub>rel</sub> = 3/4:
        *   v<sub>bullet</sub> = (3/4 + 3/4) / (1 + (3/4)*(3/4) ) = (6/4) / (25/16) = **24/25**
    *   **(3)** Light flash in spacebus: v'<sub>bullet</sub> = 1, v<sub>rel</sub> = 3/4:
        *   v<sub>bullet</sub>  =  (1 + 3/4) / (1 + 1*(3/4)) = (7/4) / (7/4)  = **1**. The speed of light is constant in all inertial frames.
    *  **(4)** Light flash toward the back of the bus: v'<sub>bullet</sub> = -1, v<sub>rel</sub> = 3/4:
        *   v<sub>bullet</sub>  =  (-1 + 3/4) / (1 + (-1)*(3/4)) = (-1/4) / (1/4) = **-1**. The speed of light is constant in all inertial frames.

### Exercise 3-12: Michelson-Morley Experiment

*   **(a)** Round-trip time with wind:
    *   Time with the wind: L / (c+v)
    *   Time against the wind: L / (c-v)
    *   Total time: L / (c+v) + L / (c-v) = 2Lc / (c<sup>2</sup> - v<sup>2</sup>)  = (2L/c) / (1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)
    *   Factor greater than still air: **1/(1 - v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)**
    *  The round trip is not the same in the presence of wind because the time spent traveling against the wind is larger than the time saved traveling with the wind.
    *  As the wind speed is nearly equal to the speed of the airplane, then the plane will take a long time to go upwind.
*   **(b)** Time for round trip perpendicular to wind
    *   Time t =  2L/ √(c<sup>2</sup> - v<sup>2</sup>)
    *   Time difference: (1/√(1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)  - 1)
*   **(c)** Approximate time difference when v << c:
    * Using the approximation (1 + z)<sup>n</sup> ≈ 1 + nz for |z| << 1
    * 1 / (1 - v<sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>) ≈ 1+ v<sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>
    * 2L/c ( 1 + v<sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup> ) -2L/c = 2L v<sup>2</sup> / c<sup>3</sup>
    *  Time difference: dt ≈ (L/2c)(v/c)<sup>2</sup>
*   **(d)** Wind speed for airplane discrepancy
    * Time difference is 4 seconds = (L/2c) * (v/c)<sup>2</sup>
    * L = 300 km, c = 300 km/hr
    * v<sup>2</sup> = 4*2*c<sup>3</sup> / L
    * v =  √ (4*2 * (300)<sup>3</sup> / (300 *1000)
    * v = √ (2*4*300*300*300)/(300*1000)) =  √ (720) ≈ **26.8 km/hr**
    *   The wind direction is along the direction connecting the location of the supply drop and the supply depot.
*   **(e)** Time difference for Michelson-Morley experiment:
    *   v = 30 * 10<sup>3</sup> m/s
    *   L = 22 m
     *Using the approximation derived in (c):*
    * dt = 22/(2 * 3 * 10<sup>8</sup>) *  (30*10<sup>3</sup> / 3 * 10<sup>8</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 2.2 *10<sup>-15</sup> seconds
*   **(f)** Period of sodium light:
    *   λ = 589 nm = 589 * 10<sup>-9</sup> m
    *   c = 3 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/s
    *   fλ = c
    *   f =  3 * 10<sup>8</sup> / (589 * 10<sup>-9</sup>) ≈ 5 * 10<sup>14</sup> Hz
    *   T = 1/f = 2 * 10<sup>-15</sup> seconds
    *   Michelson and Morley result implies that the ether speed was less than 1/100 of 1 wavelength period or:
    *   1/100 * 2 *10<sup>-15</sup> s / 22 m < 2 / 100 * 10<sup>-16</sup> / 10
    * The ratio of the speed of the ether to the speed of light is less than 1/6
*   **(g)** Does the Michelson-Morley experiment disprove the ether theory?
    *   The Michelson-Morley experiment **did not disprove the existence of the ether**. The experiment demonstrated that the speed of light is the same in all directions. It did not measure the speed of light relative to the ether. It is still possible to modify the ether theory to be consistent with the null result, such as by assuming that the ether moves with matter or that the instruments contract with motion. However, the principle of relativity provides a more straightforward explanation, eliminating the need for an ether.

### Exercise 3-13: The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment

*   **(a)** Time difference between paths:
    *   t = 2Δl / c, where Δl = difference in path lengths
    *  Time difference: 2 * 0.16 / (3 * 10<sup>8</sup>) ≈ 1 * 10<sup>-9</sup> seconds
*   **(b)** Number of periods:
    *    n = t/T = (1 * 10<sup>-9</sup> s) / (1.82 * 10<sup>-15</sup> s) ≈  5 * 10<sup>5</sup> periods
*   **(c)** Round-trip speed of light:
    *  c = (2/n) *  Δl / T
    * If n remains constant as Earth orbits the Sun, then c is constant.
*   **(d)** Fractional change in speed of light:
    * Take the differential of the equation in part c:
    * dc/c = -dn/n
    * dn/n < 3/1000
    * dc / c < 3/1000
    * The change in the speed of light is less than 3 parts in 1000
*   The Michelson Morley experiment was designed to detect relative motion between Earth and the ether. The Kennedy-Thorndike experiment was designed to test the assumption that the round trip speed of light is the same in all inertial frames.
* The experiment of Kennedy and Thorndike ruled out Theory A, that length contraction was the sole consequence of movement through the ether and was consistent with Theory B which included time dilation as a result of movement through the ether, as well as the results predicted by relativity.

### Exercise 3-14: Things That Move Faster Than Light

*   **(a)** Scissors Paradox
    *   v<sub>A</sub> = v<sub>rod</sub> / sin θ
    *   v<sub>A</sub> > c if sin θ < v<sub>rod</sub> /c
    * The speed v<sub>A</sub> can be greater than the speed of light, and this occurs when sin θ is small. No, the motion of intersection point A cannot be used to transmit a message faster than light because it is not the motion of a physical object.
*   **(b)** Transmission of a Hammer Pulse
    *   No, the motion of the intersection point **cannot transmit a message** faster than light. It is not a real signal traveling at that speed.
*   **(c)** Searchlight Messenger
    * Yes, the speed of the light beam can exceed the speed of light, however, because this speed does not correspond to motion of matter or energy, this method **cannot transmit a message** faster than light.
*   **(d)** Oscilloscope Writing Speed
    *   The speed of the spot on the screen can be greater than the speed of light. However, the spot itself is not a physical entity that carries information. The information is carried by the electrons accelerating in the oscilloscope, which do not exceed light speed.

### Exercise 3-15: Four Times the Speed of Light?

*   **(a)** Apparent speed of approaching rocket
    *   Distance: L<sub>1</sub> - L<sub>2</sub> = x
    *   Time = t<sub>1</sub> - t<sub>2</sub>  = ( L<sub>1</sub>/c - x/c) - L<sub>2</sub>/c
    *   Apparent speed: v<sub>app</sub> = ( L<sub>1</sub> - L<sub>2</sub>) /  (( L<sub>1</sub>/c - x/c) - L<sub>2</sub>/c) = c * x/(x-v*t)
    *  v<sub>app</sub> = x/ ((x/c) * (1 - v/c)) = c / (1-v/c)
    * For v<sub>app</sub> = 4c: 4c = c / (1-v/c)  =>  4 -4v/c = 1 => v = 3/4c
    *  For v<sub>app</sub> = 99c: 99c = c / (1-v/c)  =>  99 -99v/c = 1 => v = 98/99c
*   **(b)** Apparent speed of recession of the rocket for the friend in San Francisco
   *    v<sub>app</sub> = c / (1 + v/c)
    * When v<sub>app</sub> = 4c for New York, v = (3/4) c
     *   v<sub>app</sub> for San Francisco = c / (1 + 3/4) = (4/7) c.
    *   When v<sub>app</sub> = 99c for New York, v = 98/99 c
    *  v<sub>app</sub> for San Francisco  = c / (1+98/99) = (99/197) c ≈ 0.5c

### Exercise 3-16: Superluminal Expansion of Quasar 3C273

*   **(a)** Earth-seen time separation
    *   dt<sub>seen</sub> =  dt  - v*dt*cos(θ)/c
    *   dt<sub>seen</sub> = dt (1- v*cos(θ) / c)
*   **(b)** Earth-seen transverse distance
    *   d<sub>seen</sub> = v*dt*sin(θ)
*   **(c)** Apparent transverse velocity
    *   v<sub>seen</sub> = v * sin(θ) / (1- (v/c)cos(θ))
    *    tr<sub>seen</sub> = v* sin(θ)/( 1- v*cos(θ))
*  **(d)**
    *  tr<sub>seen</sub> when θ = 0: tr<sub>seen</sub> = 0
    *  tr<sub>seen</sub> when θ = 90: tr<sub>seen</sub> = v
    *  tr<sub>seen</sub> > c when v > c (1-vcosθ), which simplifies to cos θ < (1-c/v)

    *   For θ = 45 degrees
     *   v / (1 - v / √2) > 1
      *  v > 1-v/√2 which implies
      *   v > √2/(√2+1) ≈ 0.586c
*   **(e)** Angle at which tr<sub>seen</sub> is maximum
     * Differentiating tr<sub>seen</sub> with respect to θ and setting it equal to 0 yields cos θ<sub>max</sub> = v/c.

*   **(f)** Maximum transverse speed for v = 0.99
    *   tr<sub>seen,max</sub> =  v/√(1-v<sup>2</sup>)  = 0.99 /√(1 - 0.99<sup>2</sup> ) ≈ 7
*   **(g)** Apparent speed of separation for Quasar 3C273
    * From the figure, the distance traveled is approximately 15.5 milliarcseconds in approximately 2 years =  15.5 * 10<sup>-3</sup> * 4.85 *10<sup>-9</sup> / 2 *3.15 *10<sup>7</sup> m/s =  1.2 * 10<sup>-18</sup>
    * The speed of the secondary source is approximately 9 times the speed of light.

### Exercise 3-17: Contraction or Rotation?

*   **(a)** How much earlier does light from E leave?
    *   Distance light travels from E to O:  √(1 + x<sup>2</sup> ) ≈ 1+ x<sup>2</sup>/2. The distance from G to O is 1.
     *The difference in time* is t  =  x / c
    * The cube has moved x = v * t = v*x/c
    *  x = v*x/c which implies x = 0
     *   *Since this distance must be greater than 1, x = v*.
    *   How far has the cube moved in this time?  v*x.
*   **(b)** Angle of apparent rotation
    *   tan φ  = x = v
    *   For v --> 0, φ --> 0. For v-->1, φ --> 45 degrees
*   **(c)** Is the word "really" appropriate in the quotes?
    *The word "really" is not appropriate in the quotes*. Both observers are correct in their frame. They are simply measuring different phenomena, because of the relativity of simultaneity and the different path lengths light has to travel. The observer looking up at the cube has additional light travel times that must be considered.

*   **(d)** How does depth perception change the view?
   * The visual distortions created by the relativity of simultaneity and the different travel path lengths for light from different corners of the cube will be somewhat mitigated by the use of depth perception, but not eliminated. The use of depth perception will make the visual distortions less apparent, but the measurements made using a latticework of rods and clocks will not be affected.

Let me know if you would like any of these solutions clarified further.
