Okay, here's a detailed scientific summary for each section in Chapter 3, drawing on the provided sources, using a mixture of markdown, LaTeX, and HTML formatting, and incorporating bold text for emphasis, as requested. Numerical and mathematical examples are provided to illustrate the concepts.

### 3.1 The Principle of Relativity

*   This section introduces the **Principle of Relativity**, which states that **all the laws of physics are the same in every free-float (inertial) reference frame**.
*   It begins with everyday examples, such as being in a car or airplane, to demonstrate that without looking outside, one cannot tell if they are moving or at rest.
*   **Galileo's thought experiment** with a ship is used to illustrate the principle. He describes how observations within a uniformly moving ship are identical to those in a stationary ship. This demonstrates that relative uniform motion does not affect the laws of physics.
*   The principle is extended from ships to unpowered spaceships to better illustrate **free-float frames**.
*   The section emphasizes that **no test of the laws of physics provides any way whatsoever to distinguish one free-float frame from another**.
*   The **Principle of Relativity rests on emptiness**, meaning space itself has no preferred reference frame, allowing different observers to use their own latticeworks of clocks and rods without conflict.

    *   While modern physics acknowledges that space is not truly empty, the principle applies in regions of spacetime that are effectively empty.

### 3.2 What is Not the Same in Different Frames

*   This section focuses on the quantities that are **not the same** when measured from different inertial frames.
*   It emphasizes that **space and time separations** are generally not the same in different frames.
*   **Velocities, accelerations, forces, and electric and magnetic fields** also differ when measured in different frames.
*   For example, a sparkplug's velocity will be measured differently by an observer in the laboratory frame versus an observer in a rocket frame.
*   The section also explains that the **speed of light** is a conversion factor between units of space and time, rather than a fundamental constant.
*   A **meter** is now defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.
    *   This means that the value of the speed of light is fixed by decree at 299,792,458 m/s.
*  **The speed of light is the same for all observers**, though they will disagree on time and space intervals.

### 3.3 What is the Same in Different Frames

*   Despite the differences, the **laws of physics** are the same in all inertial frames.
*  For example, the relation between **force and acceleration** is the same in both a laboratory frame and a rocket frame, though the numerical values of the force and acceleration may differ.
*   **Fundamental physical constants**, such as the elementary charge on an electron and the speed of light, also remain the same in all inertial frames.
*   The value of the speed of light must be the same in overlapping free-float frames, otherwise these frames could be distinguished from one another and the Principle of Relativity violated.
*  The **numerical value of the speed of light** has been established by decree, underscoring its role as a conversion factor between units of space and time.
*   **Sample Problem 3-1** gives examples of quantities that are the same (speed of light, order of elements) and quantities that are not (speed of an electron, time between two events).

### 3.6 Invariance of Transverse Dimension

*   This section addresses whether a moving object is measured to get thinner as well as shorter as it moves faster and faster.
*   It concludes that **high speed has no measurable effect on transverse dimensions**. There is no observed thinning or fattening of fast objects.
*   Thought experiments, such as the **Speeding-Train** and **Speeding-Pipes**, demonstrate this.
    *   If transverse dimensions changed, the wheels of a train might slip off the tracks, and pipes might pass inside each other in different reference frames.
*  The **invariance of transverse dimensions** also applies to events; two events with separation only transverse to the direction of relative motion and simultaneous in one frame, are also simultaneous in all frames.

### 3.7 Invariance of the Interval Proved

*   This section demonstrates a key consequence of the Principle of Relativity: the **invariance of the spacetime interval**.
*   The spacetime interval is defined as the square of the time separation minus the square of the space separation between two events: $$\text{interval}^2 = (\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2$$.
*   A thought experiment is used in which a light flash is emitted from a rocket, travels to a mirror, and then is reflected back to a detector on the rocket.
    *   In the **rocket frame**, the space separation between the emission and reception of the light is zero, and the time separation is 6 meters of light-travel time, giving an interval of 6 meters.
*   In the **laboratory frame**, the rocket moves during the round trip of the light, so the light travels a longer, slanted path. The light travels 10 meters of light-travel time.
    *   Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the light path, the space separation is calculated as 8 meters, and the time separation is 10 meters.
    *   The interval is calculated as: $$\text{interval}^2 = (10 \text{ meters})^2 - (8 \text{ meters})^2 = 100 - 64 = 36 \text{ meters}^2$$, which means the interval is 6 meters in this example.
*   **Table 3-1** summarizes the different measurements of space and time in rocket and laboratory frames, yet shows how they result in the same spacetime interval.
*   The interval is invariant, meaning that it has the same value for all observers in inertial frames, despite disagreements about space and time separations individually.
*   The invariance of the interval is a central result of special relativity, demonstrating that there is no absolute time difference between two events.

### 3.9 Summary

*   This section summarizes the key concepts of the chapter, emphasizing that **the laws of physics are the same in every inertial (free-float) reference frame**.
*   It reiterates several consequences of the Principle of Relativity:
    *   **Relativity of simultaneity:** Events simultaneous in one frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another frame if they are separated in the direction of motion.
    *   **Lorentz contraction:** An object in high-speed motion is measured to be shorter along its direction of motion than its proper length (measured in its rest frame).
    *   **Invariance of transverse distances:** Dimensions of moving objects perpendicular to the motion are measured to be the same in different frames.
    *   **Simultaneity of transverse events:** Events with separation only transverse to the motion that are simultaneous in one frame are also simultaneous in all frames.
*   The chapter concludes by noting that the **rocket time can be very much smaller than the laboratory time** as the rocket approaches the speed of light. This means that in principle, one can go to any remote star in a short time, despite speed limits.
*   The text stresses that while our speed is limited by the speed of light, the distance we can travel is unlimited.
*   **The invariance of the interval is based on the principle of relativity** and is due to both invariance of transverse distance and invariance of the speed of light.

### Other Key Concepts from Exercises

*   **Sample Problem 3-2, the K+ Meson:** The half-life of a particle in its own rest frame can be calculated by measuring the decay rate in a laboratory frame and using the invariant interval.
    *   For example, if a beam of K+ mesons travels 9 meters and only one quarter of them survive, this corresponds to two half-lives.
*   **Relativity and Swimming (Exercise 3-1):**  A swimmer takes different amounts of time to swim a distance with and against a current; this is different than the case of light, whose speed is always the same relative to all observers.
*   **Einstein Puzzler (Exercise 3-2):** A runner will always see herself in the mirror, even at speeds close to the speed of light.
*  **Construction of Clocks (Exercise 3-3):** All clocks will run at the same rate relative to one another within a free-float frame, even when that rate is different when measured from another free-float frame.
*   **Principle of Relativity (Exercise 3-4):** Quantities like the spacetime interval and the structure of DNA are the same in overlapping free-float frames, but things like the kinetic energy of an electron and the magnetic field at a point are not.
*   **Down with Relativity! (Exercise 3-6):** Presents objections to relativity and then answers them, highlighting that the theory is logical and self-consistent.
*   **Cerenkov Radiation (Exercise 3-8):** Explores Cerenkov radiation, which is emitted when particles travel faster than light in a medium, showing that the angle of the light cone is related to the particle's speed in that medium: $$\cos \phi = \frac{v_{\text{light}}}{v}$$,.
    *   For example, the minimum velocity for Cerenkov radiation in Lucite is 2/3 the speed of light and in water, the minimum is 0.75 the speed of light.
*   **Aberration of Starlight (Exercise 3-9):**  The apparent direction of starlight changes due to the motion of the observer, and the aberration angle can be calculated using trigonometry.
    *   The angle of aberration can be calculated as $$\tan \psi = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}$$, and Earth's motion causes an apparent shift of about 20.5 seconds of arc.
*   **The Expanding Universe (Exercise 3-10):** Observation of light from stars can be used to verify the expansion of the universe by analyzing the red shift of the light using the Doppler effect.
    *   The recession velocity of stars can be determined by comparing observed and proper periods of spectral lines.
    *   For example, a quasar with a redshift of 5.9 has a velocity of 0.94 the speed of light.
*  **Law of Addition of Velocities (Exercise 3-11):** Two speeds cannot simply be added together; relativistic addition of velocities is given by: $$V_{\text{combined}} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}$$.
    *  When dealing with everyday speeds, the equation simplifies to the simple addition of velocities.
*  **Michelson-Morley Experiment (Exercise 3-12):** This experiment failed to detect the motion of Earth through the "ether".
    *   The time difference between light traveling in perpendicular directions is extremely small, but the use of interference allows it to be observed, and the results of the experiment are explained by the fact that the speed of light is constant in every inertial frame.
*  **The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment (Exercise 3-13):** This experiment tested the isotropy of the speed of light and measured the change in interference patterns between paths of unequal length due to motion.
    *   The results of the experiment are consistent with the speed of light being the same in all inertial frames and that a clock's frequency is not affected by the velocity.
*  **Things That Move Faster Than Light (Exercise 3-14):** Objects such as the point of intersection of a long rod and the axis along which the rod moves can move faster than light, but these cannot be used to transmit information faster than light.
* **Four Times the Speed of Light? (Exercise 3-15):** An approaching rocket can appear to move faster than the speed of light due to the way that we receive light from the rocket as it moves, while a receding rocket will never appear to move away at more than half the speed of light.
*   **Superluminal Expansion of Quasar 3C273? (Exercise 3-16):** The apparent speed of separation of parts of a quasar can be greater than the speed of light due to the geometry of how the light reaches the observer from a source moving at relativistic speeds.
    *   The apparent time separation is given by: $$\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = \Delta t \left(1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos\theta\right)$$, and the apparent transverse speed is given by: $$v_{\text{seen, max}} = \frac{v}{1 - v^2}$$.
* **Contraction or Rotation (Exercise 3-17):** Explores how a moving cube will be seen with the eye versus how it will be measured by a latticework of clocks. The cube will appear rotated due to the time it takes for light from different points to reach the viewer, with the angle of rotation being given by: $$\tan \phi = v$$, where v is the velocity of the cube in the laboratory frame.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and examples discussed in Chapter 3 of the source material.


Okay, here are the detailed solutions to the exercises in Chapter 3, drawing on the provided sources:

### Exercise 3-1: Relativity and Swimming

This exercise contrasts the behavior of a swimmer in water with the behavior of light in space to highlight the remarkable nature of the invariance of the speed of light.

**(a) How long does it take her to swim down the length of a 30-meter pool and back again?**

*   The swimmer's speed is 1 meter/second.
*   The distance for one length of the pool is 30 meters, so the roundtrip distance is 60 meters.
*   Time = Distance/Speed = 60 meters / (1 meter/second) = 60 seconds

**(b) How long does it take her to swim from float A to float B and back again when the two floats, A and B, are still 30 meters apart, but now are being towed through a lake at 1/3 meter/second?**

*   **Downstream:**
    *   The swimmer's speed relative to the floats is 1 m/s, and the distance to swim is 30 m.
    *   The time it takes the swimmer to reach the float is 30 meters / (1 m/s + 1/3 m/s) = 22.5 seconds
*   **Upstream:**
    *   The swimmer's speed relative to the floats is 1 m/s, and the distance to swim is 30 m.
    *   The time it takes the swimmer to return to the original float is 30 meters / (1 m/s - 1/3 m/s) = 45 seconds
*   **Total time:** 22.5 seconds + 45 seconds = 67.5 seconds

**(c) Is it true that the total time from A to B and back again is independent of the reference system ("stationary" pool ends vs. moving floats)?**

*   No, the total time is **not independent** of the reference system. In the stationary pool, the roundtrip time was 60 seconds. With the moving floats, the total time was 67.5 seconds.

**(d) Express in the cleanest, clearest, sharpest one-sentence formulation you can the difference between what happens for the swimmer and what happens for a light flash.**

*   The speed of a swimmer is relative to the medium through which she is swimming, and depends on the motion of that medium, while the speed of a light flash is constant regardless of the motion of its source or the observer.

### Exercise 3-2: Einstein Puzzler

This exercise explores how the principle of relativity applies to a thought experiment about a runner and a mirror.

*   According to the Principle of Relativity, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Therefore, the runner will see her reflection in the mirror regardless of her speed.  The physics of reflection doesn't change just because the observer is moving at a high speed.

### Exercise 3-3: Construction of Clocks

This exercise explores how different types of clocks behave in a free-float frame.

*   If all the clocks are adjusted to run at the same rate when at rest in the laboratory, they will also run at the same rate relative to each other in the free-float rocket frame. This is because the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
*   However, the clock rate of these clocks measured by the rocket observer will be different than the common rate measured by the laboratory observer. This is because time is relative, and the rate at which time passes depends on the observer's frame of reference.

### Exercise 3-4: The Principle of Relativity

This exercise tests understanding of which quantities are the same and which are different in two overlapping free-float frames.

**(a) time it takes for light to go one meter of distance in a vacuum:**
*   Yes, this is the same in all free-float frames. This is the speed of light, which is invariant.

**(b) spacetime interval between two events:**
*   Yes, the spacetime interval is invariant, meaning it has the same value in all free-float frames.

**(c) kinetic energy of an electron:**
*   No, kinetic energy is not necessarily the same in different frames, as velocity is relative.

**(d) value of the mass of the electron:**
*   Yes, the mass of the electron is a fundamental constant and is the same in all frames.

**(e) value of the magnetic field at a given point:**
*   No, the magnetic field is not necessarily the same in different frames.  Electric and magnetic fields are frame-dependent.

**(f) distance between two events:**
*   No, distance between events depends on the frame of reference.

**(g) structure of the DNA molecule:**
*   Yes, the structure of DNA is the same in all inertial frames.

**(h) time rate of change of momentum of a neutron:**
*   No, this is force, and force is not the same in different frames, and depends on the observer's frame of reference.

### Exercise 3-5: Many Unpowered Rockets

This exercise explores how events are perceived in different rocket frames.
* In the laboratory frame, event 1 occurs at (x=0, t=0) and event 2 occurs at (x=6, t=10).

**(a) In rocket frame A, event 2 occurs at time t' = 14 years. At what position x' will event 2 occur in this frame?**

*  We use the invariance of the interval: (t')² - (x')² = t² - x²
*  (14)² - (x')² = (10)² - (6)²
*  196 - (x')² = 100 - 36
*  196 - (x')² = 64
*  (x')² = 132
*  x' = √132 ≈ 11.49 light-years.

**(b) In rocket frame B, event 2 occurs at position x" = 5 light-years. At what time t" will event 2 occur in this frame?**

*  We again use the invariance of the interval: (t")² - (x")² = t² - x²
*  (t")² - (5)² = (10)² - (6)²
*  (t")² - 25 = 100 - 36
*  (t")² - 25 = 64
*  (t")² = 89
*  t" = √89 ≈ 9.43 years.

**(c) How fast must rocket frame C move if events 1 and 2 occur at the same place in this rocket frame?**
*   For events to occur at the same place in the rocket frame, the space separation (x') must be zero.
*   The time between the two events in the lab frame is t=10 and the distance is x=6.
*   The proper time in frame C (when the two events are in the same place) can be found using the invariant interval. (t')²=t²-x²=(10)²-(6)² = 100-36=64, so t'=8.
*   The time dilation formula is t' = t √(1-v²), so 8 = 10 √(1-v²), and .8 = √(1-v²)
*   Squaring both sides we get: .64 = 1-v², so v² = .36, and v = 0.6
*   The rocket must move at 60% the speed of light.

**(d) What is the time between events 1 and 2 in rocket frame C of part c?**
* As we calculated in part c, the time between the two events in the rocket frame is 8 years.

### Exercise 3-6: Down with Relativity!

This exercise addresses common objections to the theory of relativity.

**(a) "Observer A says that B's clock goes slow, and observer B says that A's clock goes slow. This is a logical contradiction. Therefore relativity should be abandoned."**

*   This is not a logical contradiction because time is relative. Each observer measures time in their own frame of reference.
*   The clocks are indeed running slower relative to the other observer, but only when they are in motion relative to one another.

**(b) "Observer A says that B's meter sticks are contracted along their direction of relative motion, and observer B says that A's meter sticks are contracted. This is a logical contradiction. Therefore relativity should be abandoned."**

*   This is also not a logical contradiction, as length is relative, as described by Lorentz contraction.
*   Each observer measures length in their own frame of reference, and the length contraction is relative to the observer's motion.

**(c) "Relativity does not even have a unique way to define space and time coordinates for the instantaneous position of an object. Laboratory and rocket observers typically record different coordinates for this position and time. Therefore anything relativity says about the velocity of the object (and hence about its motion) is without meaning."**

*   Relativity does not claim to have a single, absolute set of coordinates. Space and time coordinates are frame-dependent.
*   However, relativity provides a consistent way to relate measurements in different frames and to describe motion in a meaningful way.

**(d) "Relativity postulates that light travels with a standard speed regardless of the free-float frame from which its progress is measured. This postulate is certainly wrong. Anybody with common sense knows that travel at high speed in the direction of a receding light pulse will decrease the speed with which the pulse recedes. Hence a flash of light cannot have the same speed for observers in relative motion. With this disproof of the basic postulate, all of relativity collapses."**

*   The constant speed of light is a postulate of relativity that has been experimentally verified, and it contradicts common sense, which is why it is not obvious.
*   The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers in inertial frames, regardless of their relative motion.

**(e) "There isn't a single experimental test of the results of special relativity."**

*   This statement is false. There are numerous experiments that confirm special relativity, such as the decay of fast-moving particles and the precise measurement of the speed of light.

**(f) "Relativity offers no way to describe an event without coordinates - and no way to speak about coordinates without referring to one or another particular reference frame. However, physical events have an existence independent of all choice of coordinates and all choice of reference frame. Hence relativity - with its coordinates and reference frames - cannot provide a valid description of these events."**

*   Relativity acknowledges that events are independent of coordinates but provides a way to relate different descriptions using the concept of the invariant interval.
*   While coordinates depend on the observer, physical laws and invariants are independent of the frame of reference.

**(g) "Relativity is preoccupied with how we observe things, not what is really happening. Hence it is not a scientific theory, since science deals with reality."**

*   Relativity provides a framework for understanding what is happening by accounting for how observations change between different frames of reference.
*   It uses the concept of the invariant interval to create a unifying description of the world.

### Exercise 3-7: Space War

This exercise involves analyzing a scenario with two rockets passing at relativistic speeds and a bullet being fired.

*   The problem is loosely stated and is designed to emphasize that simultaneity is relative.
*   In observer O's frame, the bullet is fired when a and a' coincide. O expects a miss because O's rocket is not contracted.
*   In observer O's frame, O expects a hit because O's rocket is not contracted.
*   The issue of hitting or missing depends on how the problem is stated in terms of the frame of reference of observers. The description of the scenario must be precise and specific about which events are simultaneous and in which frame.

### Exercise 3-8: Cerenkov Radiation

This exercise explores Cerenkov radiation, which occurs when a charged particle moves through a medium faster than light travels in that medium.

**(a) From this information, use the first figure to show that the half-angle φ of the light cone is given by the expression cos φ = v_light / v**

*   The light emitted by the charged particle forms a cone with a half-angle φ.
*   The speed of the particle is v, and the speed of light in the medium is v_light.
*   In the time it takes the particle to move a distance vt, the light moves a distance v_light t.
*   Using trigonometry, cos φ = (v_light t) / (vt) = v_light / v

**(b) Consider the plastic with the trade name Lucite, for which v_light = 2/3. What is the minimum velocity that a charged particle can have if it is to produce Cerenkov radiation in Lucite? What is the maximum angle φ at which Cerenkov radiation can be produced in Lucite?**

*   For Cerenkov radiation to occur, v must be greater than v_light.
*   Minimum velocity: v > v_light = 2/3 the speed of light.
*   Maximum angle: when v approaches infinity, cos φ approaches v_light / ∞ = 0.
*   Thus, the maximum angle φ is 90 degrees.

**(c) In water, the speed of light is approximately v_light = 0.75. Answer the questions of part b for the case of water.**

*   Minimum velocity: v > v_light = 0.75 the speed of light.
*  Maximum angle: when v approaches infinity, cos φ approaches v_light / ∞ = 0.
*   Thus, the maximum angle φ is 90 degrees.

### Exercise 3-9: Aberration of Starlight

This exercise explains the phenomenon of stellar aberration, where a star's apparent position is slightly different due to Earth's motion.

**(a) Find a trigonometric expression for the aberration angle ψ shown in the figure.**

*   tan ψ = v_Earth / c
*   This relationship comes from the relative velocity of the light reaching the Earth observer compared to an observer at rest relative to the Sun. The angle is formed by the motion of Earth and the direction of light from the star.

**(b) Evaluate your expression using the speed of Earth around Sun, v_Earth = 30 kilometers/second. Find the answer in radians and in seconds of arc. (One degree equals 60 minutes of arc; one minute equals 60 seconds of arc.)**

*   v_Earth = 30,000 m/s, and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s
*   tan ψ ≈ ψ (since ψ is small) = (30,000 m/s) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 1 x 10^-4 radians
*   To convert to seconds of arc: (1 x 10^-4 rad) * (180/π deg/rad) * (3600 arcsec/deg) ≈ 20.6 arcseconds.

**(c) The nonrelativistic answer to this problem - the answer using nonrelativistic physics - is tan ψ = v_Earth (in meters/meter). Do you think that the experimental difference between relativistic and nonrelativistic answers for stellar aberration observed from Earth can be the basis of a crucial experiment to decide between the correctness of the two theories?**

*   The non-relativistic approximation for the aberration angle ψ is tan ψ = v_Earth / c.
*   The difference between relativistic and non-relativistic values for stellar aberration is extremely small and would not be a practical experiment to distinguish between the theories.

**(d) A rocket in orbit around Earth suddenly changes its velocity from a very small fraction of the speed of light to v = 0.5 with respect to Sun, moving in the same direction as Earth is moving around Sun. In what direction will the rocket astronaut now see the star of parts a and b?**

*   The astronaut will now see the star shifted in the direction of the rocket's motion with a new aberration angle which will be greater than the aberration angle when the rocket's velocity was small. The new aberration angle is given by tan ψ = v_rocket / c, where v_rocket is the rocket's velocity relative to the Sun (0.5c).

### Exercise 3-10: The Expanding Universe

This exercise explains how the expansion of the universe can be observed using light from distant stars and galaxies.

**(a) A giant bomb explodes in otherwise empty space. What is the nature of the motion of one fragment relative to another? And how can this relative motion be detected?**

*   Fragments move away from each other. This relative motion can be detected by analyzing the change in frequency of light emitted by the moving fragments as observed from any other fragment.
*   If a fragment emits light pulses at proper time intervals dτ, an observer on another fragment will receive these pulses at time intervals dt
*  The relationship between the velocities of fragments in different frames is v = (dt/dτ)2-1/(dt/dτ)2+1

**(b) How can observation of the light from stars be used to verify that the universe is expanding?**

*   The observed period of the light in spectral lines from starlight can be measured on Earth. The same kind of atom can be excited in the laboratory to emit light while at rest. By comparing the periods, a red shift can be observed in the starlight.
*   The red shift is a direct measurement of the velocity of expansion and confirms the universe is expanding.

**(c) The brightest steadily shining objects in the heavens are called quasars...According to the theory of this exercise, what is the velocity of recession of this quasar, as a fraction of the speed of light?**

*  The quasar has a redshift of z = 5.9, which is equal to dt/dτ.
*  v = (z2-1)/(z2+1)
*  v = ((5.9)² - 1) / ((5.9)² + 1) ≈ 0.97
*   The quasar's recession velocity is 0.97 times the speed of light.

### Exercise 3-11: Law of Addition of Velocities

This exercise derives the relativistic law for the addition of velocities.

**(a) First use Earth observers to record the motions of the spacebus... Show that this distance (measured in the Earth frame) equals the length of the bus plus the distance the bus travels in the same time:**

*   The time for light to travel to the front of the bus as seen in Earth frame is t_forward = L + V_rel * t_forward.
*   This leads to equation (1) t_forward = L / (1-V_rel)

**(b) In the Earth frame, how much time, t_backward, is required for the light flash to move from the front of the bus to the back of the bus?**

*   The time for light to travel to the back of the bus as seen in Earth frame is t_backward = L - V_rel * t_backward.
*   This leads to equation (2) t_backward = L / (1+V_rel)

**(c) In the Earth frame, the time required for the bullet to move from the rear of the bus to the front is given by t_bullet = L / (V_bullet + V_rel). Then Fred's seat is located at position fL where f= t_bullet * (V_bullet + V_rel)/ L (equation 3)**

* This is the position of Fred's seat as measured by the Earth observer.
* This is the relationship between Fred's seat location, the speed of the bullet and the speed of the bus.

**(d) Substitute equations for the times (1) and (2) into equation (3)...Show that this result can be written (1-V_bullet) (1+v_rel)f=(1+V_bullet) (1-v_rel)**

*   Starting with equation (3): f =  t_bullet * (V_bullet + V_rel) / L
*   Substitute equation (1) t_forward and equation (2) t_backward and equate the numerators and denominators, which gives:
*   (1 - V_bullet) (1+v_rel) f = (1+V_bullet) (1-v_rel)

**(e) Now repeat the development of parts a through d for the spacebus frame...Show that the result is: (1 - v'_bullet) f = (1 + v'_bullet)**

*   Repeating the argument for the spacebus frame, the result is:
*   (1 - v'_bullet) f = (1+ v'_bullet)

**(f) Do the two fractions f in equations (4) and (5) have the same value?...Equate the two expressions for f given in equations (4) and (5) and solve for V_bullet to obtain the Law of Addition of Velocities:**

*   The fractions f in (4) and (5) are equivalent, since the position of Fred is the same in both.
*   Equating the two expressions for f, we have:
  *    (1 - v'_bullet) f = (1+ v'_bullet) = (1+V_bullet) (1-v_rel)  / (1 - V_bullet) (1+v_rel)
  *  Solving for V_bullet we get the law of addition of velocities:
  *   V_bullet = (v'_bullet + v_rel) / (1 + v'_bullet * v_rel)

**(g) Explore some consequences of the Law of Addition of Velocities:**

*   **(1) Express bus on Earth:**
    *   v_rel = 30 m/s, and v'_bullet = 600 m/s.
    *   v_rel/c ≈ 10^-7 and v'_bullet/c ≈ 2x10^-6
    *   The product v'_bullet * v_rel is tiny so the denominator is approximately equal to 1. The result is approximately the non-relativistic addition of velocities as expected.
*   **(2) Bullet with v'_bullet= 3/4 and v_rel=3/4:**
    *  V_bullet = (0.75 + 0.75) / (1+ (0.75)(0.75)  = (1.5) / (1.5625)  = .96
    *   The Earth observer will measure the bullet to be going 0.96 c.
*   **(3) Light flash with v'_bullet=1 and v_rel=3/4:**
    *   V_bullet = (1 + 0.75) / (1 + (1)(0.75)) = 1.75 / 1.75 = 1.
    * The Earth observer will measure the speed of light as 1 c.
*   **(4) Light flash with v'_bullet=-1 and v_rel=3/4:**
    *   V_bullet = (-1 + 0.75) / (1 + (-1)(0.75)) = -0.25/0.25 = -1
    * The Earth observer will measure the speed of light as -1 c.
* The Principle of Relativity is upheld, and the speed of light is invariant.

### Exercise 3-12: Michelson-Morley Experiment

This exercise analyzes the Michelson-Morley experiment, designed to detect the "ether drift," and why the experiment had a null result.

**(a) An airplane moves with airspeed c...Show that the time for a round trip from A to B and back to A under these circumstances is greater by a factor 1/(1-v^2/c^2) than the corresponding round trip time in still air.**

*   Time from A to B (against the wind): t_AB = L / (c - v)
*   Time from B to A (with the wind): t_BA = L / (c + v)
*   Total time = t_AB + t_BA = L/(c-v) + L/(c+v) =  2Lc/(c^2-v^2) = (2L/c) / (1-v^2/c^2)
*   The time in still air is 2L/c. Thus the time for a roundtrip from A to B and back to A is greater by a factor of 1/(1 - v^2/c^2)

**(b) The same airplane now makes a round trip between A and C...Show that the round-trip time between A and C under these circumstances is greater by a factor 1/√(1-v^2/c^2) than the corresponding round-trip time in still air.**

*   The plane must fly at an angle so that the resultant velocity is in the direction of AC
*   The resulting velocity vector makes a right triangle with c, with hypotenuse c, and one leg as v.  The other leg (component along AC) is thus √(c² - v²)
*   Time to C: L / √(c²-v²)
*   Time from C: L / √(c²-v²)
*   Total time: 2L / √(c²-v²) = (2L/c) / √(1-v²/c²)
*   Thus, the roundtrip time is greater by a factor of 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2)

**(c) Two airplanes with the same airspeed c start from A at the same time...Which one will arrive home first, and what will be the difference in their arrival times?**

*   From parts a and b, the time for AB is (2L/c) / (1 - v^2/c^2), and the time for AC is (2L/c) / √(1 - v^2/c^2)
*   Since (1-v^2/c^2) is less than √(1-v^2/c^2), the time for AB is greater. The airplane going from A to C will arrive first.
*   The time difference is (2L/c) * ( (1 / (1-v^2/c^2)) - (1 / √(1-v^2/c^2)) )
*   Using the binomial approximation, (1 + z)^n ≈ 1 + nz, for small z
*   (1 - v^2/c^2)^-1 ≈ 1 + v^2/c^2 and (1 - v^2/c^2)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + 0.5 * v^2/c^2
*   The approximate time difference is
(2L/c) * ( (1 + v^2/c^2) - (1 + 0.5 * v^2/c^2) ) =  (2L/c) * 0.5 * v^2/c^2 = (L/2c)(v/c)^2

**(d) The South Pole Air Station...What is the wind speed at the altitude where the planes fly? What can the Fussbudget say about the direction of this wind?**

*   The discrepancy in return times is due to the wind. The time for AB is longer than for AC. The first to return would be the plane flying perpendicular to the wind. The last to return would be the plane flying against the wind.
*  Using the time difference from part c, Δt = (L/2c)(v/c)^2
*  Δt = 4 seconds. L = 2 * 300 km = 600,000 meters. c = 300 km/hr = 83.33 m/s.
*  4 =  (600,000 / (2*83.33) ) * (v / 83.33)2
*  v ≈ 2.31 m/s or about 8.33 km/hr.
*   The wind must be blowing from the direction opposite the fastest returning plane.

**(e) In their famous experiment Michelson and Morley attempted to detect the so-called ether drift...what is the approximate difference in time of return between light flashes that are emitted simultaneously and travel along the two perpendicular paths?**
*   Using the time difference formula derived in part c : Δt = (L/2c) * (v/c)^2
*   L = 22 meters.  v = 30,000 m/s, c = 3 x 10^8 m/s
*    Δt = (22/ (2 * 3 * 10^8)) * (3 * 10^4 / (3 * 10^8))^2 = (11/ 3 * 10^8) * (10^-8) = 3.67 x 10^-16 seconds.

**(f) The original Michelson-Morley interferometer is diagrammed in the figure...Show that one period of sodium light corresponds to about 2 x 10^-15 seconds. Now there is no way to "turn off" the alleged ether drift, adjust the apparatus, and then turn the alleged ether drift on again...show that this result implies that the motion of the ether at the surface of Earth - if it exists at all- is less than one sixth of the speed of Earth in its orbit.**

*   λ = 589 nm = 589 x 10^-9 meters.  c = 3 x 10^8 m/s
*   c = f λ = λ / T. T = λ/c  = 589 x 10^-9 / 3 x 10^8 ≈ 1.96 x 10^-15 seconds.
*   Michelson and Morley found that the time difference was less than 1/100 of the time corresponding to one cycle of sodium light.
*   So, the maximum time difference is (1/100) * (1.96 x 10^-15) ≈ 2 x 10^-17 s.
*   2 * Δt  = (L/c)(v/c)^2
*   v = c * √(2 * Δt / L) =  3 x 10^8 *  √( 2 * 2 x 10^-17 / 22 ) = 2.34 x 10^6 m/s
*   The speed of Earth in its orbit is 30,000 m/s, and the ratio of the ether speed is 2.34 x 10^6/30,000 = 78
*   The ether drift was less than 1/6 of Earth's orbital speed.

**(g) Discussion question: Does the Michelson - Morley experiment, by itself, disprove the theory that light is propagated through an ether? Can the ether theory be modified to agree with the results of this experiment? How? What further experiment can be used to test the modified theory?**

*   The Michelson-Morley experiment does not disprove the ether theory by itself, but it made it difficult to maintain the ether hypothesis.
*   The ether theory can be modified to agree with the results by postulating that the ether is dragged along with the Earth, but this contradicts the original idea of the ether as a universal medium.
*   The Kennedy-Thorndike experiment can test a modified ether theory.

### Exercise 3-13: The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment

This exercise focuses on the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, designed to test the assumption that the round-trip speed of light is the same in different inertial frames.

**(a) Assume that one arm of the interferometer is longer than the other arm. Show that a flash of light entering the apparatus will take a time 2Δl/c longer to complete the round trip along the longer arm than along the shorter arm.**

*   The round trip time is T = 2l/c.
*   Thus, if one arm is longer by Δl, the difference in the roundtrip time will be T_long - T_short = 2(l+Δl) / c  - 2l / c =  2Δl / c.

**(b) Instead of a pulse of light, Kennedy and Thorndike used continuous monochromatic light...Light that traverses the longer arm of the interferometer will return approximately how many periods n later than light that traverses the shorter arm?**

*   The time difference is 2Δl / c, from part a.
*   The time for one period is T.
*  The number of periods is given by  n= (2Δl / c) / T = 2Δl / (cT).

**(c) Earth continues on its path around Sun... What would this hypothetical result tell about the numerical value c of the speed of light?**

*   We have:  c = (2/n) * (Δl/T).
*  If n is constant, this means c is also constant.
*   Thus, the speed of light is the same in both frames.
*  In this equation Δl is a length standard and T is a time standard.

**(d) In order to carry out the experiment outlined in the preceding paragraphs, Kennedy and Thorndike would have had to keep their interferometer operating perfectly for half a year... Take the differential of the equation in part c to find the largest fractional change dc/c of the round-trip speed of light between the two frames consistent with this estimated change in n.**

*   From part c, we have c= (2/n) * (Δl/T)
* Taking the differential with respect to n, we get dc= (-2 Δl  / Tn²) dn.  dc/c= -dn/n
* Since Δn is less than 3/1000, the change in the value of c was less than 3/1000.

### Exercise 3-14: Things That Move Faster Than Light

This exercise explores scenarios where objects or patterns might appear to move faster than light.

**(a) The Scissors Paradox. Find the speed VA of the point of intersection A of the lower edge of the stick with the x-axis. Can this speed be greater than the speed of light? If so, for what values of the angle θ and Vrod does this occur? Can the motion of intersection point A be used to transmit a message faster than light from someone at the origin to someone far out on the x-axis?**

*  VA =  Vrod / tan(θ)
*  VA can be greater than the speed of light. This occurs when tan(θ) is less than 1, and Vrod is large.
*   The motion of the intersection cannot be used to transmit a message faster than light. The intersection point is not a physical object with mass, and thus does not transmit energy.

**(b) Transmission of a Hammer Pulse. Can this motion of the point of intersection be used to transmit a message faster than the speed of light?**
* No, even though the intersection point is moving to the right, it does not carry information. It is not a physical object that is being moved.

**(c) Searchlight Messenger? Under these circumstances, has a warning message traveled from A to B with a speed faster than that of light?**
*   No, the message has not traveled faster than light. The searchlight beam is not carrying a message.
*   The light is still traveling at the speed of light between the searchlight and A or B, just like the scissors example, no physical object that is carrying information has moved faster than light.

**(d) Oscilloscope Writing Speed. The manufacturer of an oscilloscope claims a writing speed (the speed with which the bright spot moves across the screen) in excess of the speed of light. Is this possible?**
*  Yes, the speed of the spot on the screen is not the speed of a physical object or a message
