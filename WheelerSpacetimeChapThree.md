Okay, here's a detailed scientific summary of each numbered section from the provided text, formatted in markdown with LaTeX code for mathematical expressions:

### 3.1 The Principle of Relativity

*   This section introduces the concept of the **Principle of Relativity**, which states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.
*   It starts with everyday examples to illustrate the difficulty in determining if one is moving or at rest without external reference points.
*   Galileo Galilei is credited with the first known formulation of this principle, using the example of a ship moving uniformly.
*   The principle implies that within a closed system (like a ship with drawn shades), one cannot determine their speed or whether they are moving at all.
*   The section emphasizes the **equivalence of different inertial reference frames**, meaning that physics operates identically within each.
*   It contrasts Galileo’s Earthbound frames of reference with free-float (inertial) frames, which are conceptualized as unpowered spaceships, where all directions are equivalent and objects untouched by force undergo no acceleration.
*   Einstein’s Principle of Relativity is presented as a generalization of Galileo’s, extending to all laws of physics, including electromagnetism and nuclear physics.

### 3.2 What is Not the Same in Different Frames

*   This section discusses what **quantities are not invariant** when measured from different inertial reference frames.
*   It clarifies that while the laws of physics are the same, measurements of time and space separations between events are typically different in different frames.
*   Velocities, accelerations, forces, and electric and magnetic fields are also not the same in different frames.
*   The section notes that motion is a stream of events, and the trajectory of a moving object (like a sparkplug) can be recorded differently by observers in relative motion.
*   It emphasizes that different reference frames will record **different velocities and forces** for the same moving object.
*   The concept of measuring devices and the choice of units for spacetime separation is explored. The text indicates that units of measurement are human constructs that can be replaced without affecting physics. For example the meter was initially defined geographically but is now defined in relation to the second and speed of light.
*   The definition of the meter is now tied to the distance light travels in a vacuum in a specific fraction of a second, thus defining the speed of light as a conversion factor.
*   The speed of light is no longer considered a fundamental constant but rather a conversion factor between the meter and the second, set by decree.

### 3.3 What is the Same in Different Frames

*   This section focuses on what **quantities remain invariant** across different inertial reference frames.
*   The fundamental laws of physics, such as the relationship between force and acceleration, are the same in all free-float frames.
*   Numerical values of basic physical constants within these laws, like the charge of an electron and the speed of light, are also invariant.
*   **The speed of light in a vacuum** (\( c = 299,792,458 \) meters per second) is a fundamental constant that is the same for all inertial frames.
*   The section explains that the consistency of the laws of physics across frames is what makes it impossible to distinguish one free-float frame from another by testing physical laws.
*   It states that experimental evidence supports the idea that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames.
*   It addresses the counter-intuitive notion of a single speed of light in all reference frames, emphasizing that it has been experimentally verified.
*   The section ends by reinforcing that the Principle of Relativity has not been experimentally disproven.

### 3.4 Relativity of Simultaneity

*   This section introduces the concept of the **relativity of simultaneity**, a direct consequence of the Principle of Relativity.
*   It states that two events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another if they are separated in space along the direction of relative motion.
*   The **Train Paradox** is used as an example, where lightning strikes the front and back of a moving train.
*   An observer on the ground sees the lightning strikes as simultaneous, while an observer on the train does not, due to the finite speed of light and their relative motion.
*   The relativity of simultaneity is emphasized as being different for different frames, only agreeing when the events occur at the same point (or in a plane perpendicular to the line of relative motion).
*   It emphasizes the importance of understanding the relativity of simultaneity to resolve apparent paradoxes in special relativity.

### 3.5 Lorentz Contraction of Length

*   This section introduces the concept of **Lorentz contraction**, which refers to the shortening of an object along its direction of motion when measured from a different inertial reference frame.
*   It states that measurements of the length of a moving rod require recording the positions of its ends simultaneously in a given frame, but simultaneity is relative.
*   Observers in different inertial frames do not agree on whether a valid length measurement has been made if the rod is moving relative to either frame.
*   The example of the Train Paradox is revisited to explain how the observer on the train measures a different length than the observer on the ground.
*   It is explained that when the rod is at rest in a frame, it has a "rest length" or "proper length," which is longer than its length measured by any other observer who sees the rod in motion.

### 3.6 Invariance of Transverse Dimension

*   This section explains that while objects contract along their direction of motion (Lorentz contraction), there is **no contraction in the transverse dimension** (perpendicular to the motion).
*   The section uses thought experiments (the Speeding-Train and Speeding-Pipes experiments) to illustrate that transverse contraction is logically inconsistent.
*   The analysis shows that if transverse contraction occurred, it would lead to contradictions, like train wheels slipping off both inside and outside the tracks at the same time, depending on the observer.
*   The lack of a consistent "axis of shrinkage" is also used to argue against transverse contraction.
*   It's concluded that transverse dimensions are measured to be the same in all inertial reference frames.
*   It is shown that if a set of events are simultaneous in one frame and separated only in the transverse direction relative to a second frame, then they are also simultaneous in the second frame.

### 3.7 Invariance of the Interval Proved

*   This section introduces and proves the concept of the **invariance of the spacetime interval**, a fundamental consequence of the Principle of Relativity.
*   It demonstrates that while space and time separations between two events vary depending on the observer’s inertial reference frame, there exists a quantity called the interval that remains constant for all observers.
*   A thought experiment is used, involving a light flash emitted from a moving rocket, reflecting off a mirror, and returning to its source.
*   The time and space separations between emission and reception of the light flash are calculated for both the rocket observer and a laboratory observer.
*   The laboratory observer measures a longer time and space separation for the light’s path, but the spacetime interval (the difference of the squares of the time and space separations) remains the same for both the laboratory and rocket observers. The interval is defined by the equation \(\text{interval}^2 = (\text{time separation})^2 - (\text{space separation})^2\).
*   It highlights that there is no absolute time difference between events, the time measured depending on the chosen frame.

### 3.8 Invariance of the Interval for All Free-Float Frames

*   This section extends the concept of the **invariance of the interval to all free-float frames**, not just two.
*   A third inertial reference frame, a "super-rocket frame" is introduced, moving at a different speed relative to the lab frame than the original rocket frame.
*   The example of the light flash experiment is revisited, this time calculating the space and time separations for the super-rocket observer.
*   It's shown that even for the super-rocket observer, the spacetime interval between the light emission and reception remains the same as in the laboratory and rocket frames.
*   It reinforces that the interval has a value of \( 6 \) meters in this example for all frames in relative motion. The equation for interval is restated as \(\text{(time separation)}^2 - \text{(space separation)}^2 = \text{(interval)}^2 \).
*   The relationship of the interval to the triangle formed by the light path is explained.

### 3.9 Summary

*   This section provides a concise summary of the key concepts of the chapter, reinforcing the main results of the Principle of Relativity.
*   The main concepts are summarized as follows:
    *   The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (free-float) reference frames.
    *   The **relativity of simultaneity**, events separated in the direction of relative motion can not be simultaneous in both frames.
    *   **Lorentz contraction** - objects appear shorter along the direction of relative motion.
    *   **Invariance of transverse distances** - dimensions perpendicular to the direction of motion remain the same for all observers.
    *   **Invariance of simultaneity for transverse events** - simultaneous events separated only in the transverse direction of motion remain simultaneous in all frames.
     *   **Invariance of the spacetime interval** - the spacetime interval between events has the same value for all observers.
    *   No object can move faster than the speed of light.
*   The principle of the invariance of the interval is used in Sample Problem 3-2 to determine the half-life of an unstable particle in its rest frame.
*   The half life is calculated using the principle of the invariance of the interval and the time dilation equation.
*   The section uses the invariance of the spacetime interval to prove that no object can travel faster than the speed of light.
*   The section notes that although the speed of an object is limited by the speed of light, there is no limitation on the distance that can be traveled in a lifetime.

This detailed summary should provide a strong grasp of the key concepts within the text you provided.

Okay, here are detailed solutions for each numbered exercise, formatted in markdown with LaTeX code for mathematical expressions:

### Exercise 3-1: Relativity and Swimming

*   **a)** Time for the swimmer to swim down and back in a 30-meter pool:
    *   Time = Distance / Speed
    *   Down: 30 meters / 1 meter/second = 30 seconds
    *   Back: 30 meters / 1 meter/second = 30 seconds
    *   Total time = 30 + 30 = **60 seconds**
*   **b)** Time for the swimmer to swim between floats A and B (30 meters apart), being towed at 1/3 m/s:
    *   Swimming with the floats:
        *   Swimmer's speed relative to floats = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 m/s
        *   Distance in the floats' frame = 30 meters
        *   Time = 30 / (2/3) = 45 seconds
    *   Swimming against the floats:
        *   Swimmer's speed relative to floats = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 m/s
        *   Distance in the floats' frame = 30 meters
        *   Time = 30 / (4/3) = 22.5 seconds
    *   Total time = 45 + 22.5 = **67.5 seconds**
*   **c)** No, the total time is not independent of the reference system. The time is 60 seconds in the stationary pool frame and 67.5 seconds in the moving float frame. The time of the trip depends on the motion of the reference frame.
*   **d)** The key difference is that the **speed of the swimmer relative to the water is always 1 m/s**, while the **speed of light is always \( c \) in all free-float frames**. The swimmer's speed relative to the floats is different depending on whether they are swimming with or against the current, but the speed of light is always measured the same regardless of the motion of the source or observer.

### Exercise 3-2: Einstein Puzzler

*   According to the **Principle of Relativity**, the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.
*   Whether the runner is moving or at rest, if they are in a uniform motion, they will see their reflection in the mirror held at arm's length.
*   The speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, including the runner's frame. So the runner will see the light reach the mirror and return to their eyes.
*   Therefore, the runner will see their reflection, regardless of how close their speed is to the speed of light.

### Exercise 3-3: Construction of Clocks

*   If all clocks are adjusted to run at the same rate in the lab, then the Principle of Relativity dictates that they must also be measured to run at the same rate in the rocket.
*   Since all the clocks are in the same inertial frame (the rocket), and the laws of physics are the same for all inertial frames, there's no reason to believe one clock will run differently from any other clock in the rocket.
*   However, the (common) clock rate measured by the rocket observer will not be the same as the (common) clock rate measured by the lab observer, due to time dilation.
*   The clock ticks will be shorter in the rocket’s rest frame than as measured in the lab frame.

### Exercise 3-4: The Principle of Relativity

*   **a)** Time it takes for light to go one meter of distance in a vacuum: **yes**, this is the definition of light speed as a constant
*   **b)** Spacetime interval between two events: **yes**, the interval is invariant in all inertial frames
*   **c)** Kinetic energy of an electron: **no**, kinetic energy depends on speed, which varies by observer
*   **d)** Value of the mass of the electron: **yes**, mass is an intrinsic property
*   **e)** Value of the magnetic field at a given point: **no**, electromagnetic fields depend on the observer's frame
*   **f)** Distance between two events: **no**, spatial separation depends on the observer's frame
*   **g)** Structure of the DNA molecule: **yes**, the fundamental structure does not vary by frame
*   **h)** Time rate of change of momentum of a neutron: **no**, force and acceleration are frame dependent

### Exercise 3-5: Many Unpowered Rockets

*   **a)** In rocket frame A, the interval is the same, so we use the invariance of the interval \((t')^2 - (x')^2 = t^2 - x^2\)
    *   \((14)^2 - (x')^2 = (10)^2 - (6)^2\)
    *   \(196 - (x')^2 = 100 - 36\)
    *   \(196 - (x')^2 = 64\)
    *   \((x')^2 = 196 - 64\)
    *   \((x')^2 = 132\)
    *   \(x' = \sqrt{132} \approx \) **11.49 light-years**
*   **b)** In rocket frame B, using the invariance of the interval:
    *   \((t'')^2 - (5)^2 = (10)^2 - (6)^2\)
    *   \((t'')^2 - 25 = 100 - 36\)
    *   \((t'')^2 = 89\)
    *   \(t'' = \sqrt{89} \approx \) **9.43 years**
*   **c)** If events occur at the same place in frame C, then \(x'''=0\), and
    *   \((t''')^2 - (0)^2 = (10)^2 - (6)^2\)
    *   \((t''')^2 = 64\)
    *   \(t''' = 8\) years
    *   The speed of frame C is found using equation (3-2) x=vt.
    *   \(v=x/t=6/10= \) **0.6**
*   **d)** The time between events 1 and 2 in rocket frame C is \(t'''= \) **8 years** as calculated in part c).

### Exercise 3-6: Down with Relativity!

*   **a)** The apparent contradiction of A saying B's clock goes slow and B saying A's clock goes slow is not a logical contradiction. This is a result of the **relativity of simultaneity**, where time is relative to the observer's frame of reference. Each observer is correct in their frame.
*   **b)** Similarly, the apparent contradiction in length contraction is resolved by the relativity of simultaneity. Each observer is correct in their frame of reference, and the measurements are different due to their relative motion. There is no objective standard of length.
*   **c)** Relativity does not have a unique way to define space and time coordinates for the instantaneous position of an object. But this doesn't mean that velocity or motion is meaningless. Different observers will measure different values of velocity. The laws of physics will remain the same for all observers.
*   **d)** The postulate that light travels with a standard speed is not wrong, it's experimentally verified. The speed of light is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion. It may appear counter-intuitive, but it is a cornerstone of relativity.
*   **e)** There are many experimental tests of special relativity. The text mentions that the consequences of relativity are tried out daily in many experiments. Time dilation in particle accelerators, for example, is a well-known and verified consequence of special relativity.
*   **f)** Relativity does not describe events without coordinates but describes events and how they are measured by observers in different frames. Coordinates are not physical things, but rather tools to help us understand nature. Physical events are real and do exist independently of our choice of coordinates.
*   **g)** Relativity is a scientific theory. It uses measurements and predictions which are tested by experiments. Relativity does not address "what is really happening", it does address what is observed and measured in the different inertial frames. The text explains that there is a difference between what is measured and what is seen with our eyes.

### Exercise 3-7: Space War

*   The problem statement is **loose in its language** because it assumes that the bullet is fired when a and a' coincide in *both* reference frames. It only coincides in the reference frame of observer 0, but not in the frame of observer 0'. The diagram at the right is therefore incorrect.
*   The error is that the bullet is fired only when points a and a' coincide in the frame of observer 0. When points a and a' coincide in the frame of 0' the bullet has already been fired earlier by observer 0.
*   In the frame of 0, the bullet is fired when a and a' coincide and travels along a line perpendicular to the direction of relative motion. Thus it misses the second ship.
*   In the frame of 0', the bullet was fired earlier and the ships move relative to each other. So when a and a' coincide for observer 0', the bullet has already been fired by 0 and will miss ship 0', just as in the frame of 0.
*   This is consistent with the Train Paradox because the events are simultaneous in one frame (0) but not the other (0').

### Exercise 3-8: Cerenkov Radiation

*   **a)** From the figure, \(\sin(\phi) = \frac{V_{\text{light}} \Delta t}{v \Delta t}\), where \(V_{\text{light}}\) is the speed of light in the medium and \(v\) is the speed of the particle.  The half-angle \(\phi\) of the light cone is given by:
    *   \(\cos(\phi) = \frac{V_{\text{light}}}{v}\)
*   **b)** For Lucite, \(V_{\text{light}} = \frac{2}{3}c\):
    *   Minimum velocity for Cerenkov radiation:  The particle must travel faster than light in the medium, so \(v > \frac{2}{3}c\)
    *   Maximum angle \(\phi\) occurs when \(v \to c\), so \(\cos(\phi) = \frac{2}{3}\), and \(\phi = \cos^{-1}(\frac{2}{3}) \approx \) **48.2 degrees**.
*   **c)** For water, \(V_{\text{light}} = 0.75c\):
    *   Minimum velocity for Cerenkov radiation:  \(v > 0.75c\)
    *  Maximum angle \(\phi\): \(\cos(\phi) = 0.75\), so \(\phi = \cos^{-1}(0.75) \approx \) **41.4 degrees**.

### Exercise 3-9: Aberration of Starlight

*   **a)** From the diagram, the aberration angle \(\psi\) can be described trigonometrically.  The tangent of the angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:
    *  \(\tan(\psi) = \frac{v_{\text{Earth}}}{c}\)
*   **b)** Using \(v_{\text{Earth}} = 30 \text{ km/s} = 3 \times 10^4\) m/s and \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8\) m/s:
    *   \(\tan(\psi) = \frac{3 \times 10^4}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-4}\)
    *   \(\psi = \arctan(10^{-4}) \approx 10^{-4}\) radians
    *   To convert radians to seconds of arc: \(1 \text{ radian} \approx 206265 \text{ arcsec}\)
    *   \(\psi \approx 10^{-4} \times 206265 \approx\) **20.6 arcseconds**
*   **c)**  The nonrelativistic answer is \(\tan(\psi) = v_{\text{Earth}}\). The relativistic correction is very small, and the experimental difference between the relativistic and nonrelativistic answers for stellar aberration observed from Earth is **not** the basis of a crucial experiment to decide between the correctness of the two theories.
*   **d)**  The rocket changes its velocity from \(v_1\) to \(v_2=0.5c\) in the direction of Earth's motion. The star appears in a direction that depends on the observer's velocity. The new aberration angle \(\psi_2\) can be calculated using the same method as parts a and b but with \(\frac{v_{Earth}+v_2}{c}\), and with the angle relative to a new reference frame. The observer would see the star shifted even more than when they were moving at the velocity of earth.

### Exercise 3-10: The Expanding Universe

*   **a)**  The relative motion of one fragment to another is that of recession from each other. A beacon that emits light will have its period measured differently by the observer when the beacon is receding.
    *   \(d t = \frac{d \tau}{1-v}\)
    *   \(v= 1-\frac{d \tau}{dt}\)
    *   The recession velocity appears greater for distant fragments.
*   **b)** Light from stars that are receding from us will have their wavelength shifted to longer wavelengths (redshift) due to the Doppler effect.
    *   This redshift can be used to measure the recession velocity of the stars by comparing the observed period with the period emitted by a stationary source.
    *   The observed velocities of recession for stars at different distances will be proportional to their distance (Hubble's Law), assuming the universe is expanding uniformly.
*   **c)**  The quasar's redshift is \( \frac{dt_{\text{reception}}}{d \tau}=5.9 \).
    *   Using the result of part a, \(v = 1-\frac{1}{5.9} \approx 0.83\)
    *   The velocity of recession of the quasar is approximately **0.83c**.

### Exercise 3-11: Law of Addition of Velocities

*   **a)**  The distance the light flash travels is the length of the bus plus the distance the bus has traveled in the same time:
    *   \(L_{\text{forward}} = L + V_{\text{rel}}t_{\text{forward}}\)
    *   Solving for \(t_{\text{forward}}\): \(t_{\text{forward}} = \frac{L}{1 - V_{\text{rel}}}\)
*   **b)**  The distance traveled by the light during the backward trip is \(fL\), but we subtract the distance the bus moves:
    *   \(L_{\text{backward}} = fL - V_{\text{rel}}t_{\text{backward}}\)
    *  Solving for \(t_{\text{backward}}\): \(t_{\text{backward}} = \frac{fL}{1 + V_{\text{rel}}}\)
*   **c)**  The total distance traveled by the light flash is \(L_{\text{forward}} - L_{\text{backward}}\). This is also equal to the distance traveled by the bullet in time \(t_{\text{forward}} + t_{\text{backward}}\):
    *   \(V_{\text{bullet}}(t_{\text{forward}} + t_{\text{backward}}) = t_{\text{forward}} - t_{\text{backward}}\)
    *   \((1 + V_{\text{bullet}})t_{\text{backward}} = (1 - V_{\text{bullet}})t_{\text{forward}}\)
*   **d)** Substitute the results for \(t_{\text{forward}}\) and \(t_{\text{backward}}\) from parts a and b into the equation in part c:
    *   \((1 + V_{\text{bullet}})\frac{fL}{1 + V_{\text{rel}}} = (1 - V_{\text{bullet}})\frac{L}{1 - V_{\text{rel}}}\)
    *   The L cancels out and the result can be written as: \((1 - V_{\text{bullet}})(1 + V_{\text{rel}})f = (1 + V_{\text{bullet}})(1 - V_{\text{rel}})\)
*   **e)**  Repeat the above for the spacebus frame, where there is no relative velocity of the bus to itself so \(V_{\text{rel}}=0\) and the bullet has speed \(v'_{\text{bullet}}\):
    *   \((1 - v'_{\text{bullet}})f = (1 + v'_{\text{bullet}})\)
*  **f)**  The fraction \(f\) must be the same in both frames:
    *  \(\frac{1+v'_{\text{bullet}}}{1-v'_{\text{bullet}}} = \frac{(1-V_{\text{bullet}})(1+V_{\text{rel}})}{(1+V_{\text{bullet}})(1-V_{\text{rel}})}\)
    *  Solving for \(V_{\text{bullet}}\) results in the **Law of Addition of Velocities**:
    *   \(V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{v'_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + v'_{\text{bullet}} V_{\text{rel}}}\)
*   **g)**
    *   **(1)** For the express bus, \(V_{\text{rel}} \approx 10^{-7}\) and \(v'_{\text{bullet}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-6}\).
        *  Their product is negligible. Equation (6) reduces to \(V_{\text{bullet}} \approx v'_{\text{bullet}} + V_{\text{rel}}\), which is what we would expect for everyday speeds.
    *  **(2)** When \(v'_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{3}{4}\) and \(V_{\text{rel}} = \frac{3}{4}\), \(V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4}}{1 + \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1.5}{1.5625} \approx\) **0.96c**.
    *   **(3)** For a light flash, \(v'_{\text{bullet}} = 1\), then \(V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{1 + V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + V_{\text{rel}}} =\) **1c**, as expected from the Principle of Relativity.
    *   **(4)** For a light flash directed toward the back \(v'_{\text{bullet}} = -1\), \(V_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{-1 + V_{\text{rel}}}{1 + -V_{\text{rel}}} =\) **-1c**, as expected from the Principle of Relativity.

### Exercise 3-12: Michelson-Morley Experiment

*   **a)** The round trip time with a wind of speed \(v\) and air speed \(c\) from A to B:
    *   Against the wind: \(t_1 = \frac{L}{c-v}\)
    *   With the wind: \(t_2 = \frac{L}{c+v}\)
    *   Total time \(t = t_1+t_2= \frac{L}{c-v} + \frac{L}{c+v} = \frac{2cL}{c^2 - v^2} = \frac{2L/c}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\)
    *   The factor is \(\frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\).  The wind increases the round-trip time because the plane spends more time traveling against the wind than with the wind. If \(v\) is nearly \(c\), the return time is very large.
*   **b)** Time for a round trip from A to C (perpendicular to the wind):
    *  \(t_1= \frac{L}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}} \) and \(t_2= \frac{L}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}} \)
    *  Total time \(t = t_1+t_2 = \frac{2L}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}} = \frac{2L/c}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \)
    *   The factor is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).
*   **c)**  The time difference will be \( \Delta t = t_{AB} - t_{AC} \):
    *  \(\Delta t = \frac{2L/c}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} -  \frac{2L/c}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{2L}{c} (\frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} -  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}) \).
    *   Using the approximation \( (1+z)^n \approx 1 + nz \) for \( z << 1 \), we have
        *   \((1-v^2/c^2)^{-1} \approx 1+v^2/c^2\) and \((1-v^2/c^2)^{-1/2} \approx 1+\frac{1}{2}v^2/c^2\)
        *    \(\Delta t \approx \frac{2L}{c} (1+ \frac{v^2}{c^2} - (1+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2}{c^2})) = \frac{2L}{c} \frac{v^2}{2c^2} = \frac{L}{c} \frac{v^2}{c^2} \)
    *   If L is the round trip distance then the time difference \(\Delta t \approx \frac{L/2c (v/c)^2\).
*   **d)** Let \(v\) be the wind speed. The time difference is given to be 4 seconds.
    *   \(4 = \frac{L}{2c}(\frac{v}{c})^2\)
    *  \(4 = \frac{2(300 \times 10^3)}{2(300 \times 10^3/3600)}(\frac{v}{300 \times 10^3/3600})^2\)
    *   \(v^2= 4\) so \(v = \pm\) **2 m/s**.
    *   The wind direction can be anything along the circle; it is the radial component of the wind that leads to the discrepancy.
*  **e)** If \(v\) is the speed of Earth around the Sun, the time difference can be approximated by \( \frac{L}{2c}(\frac{v}{c})^2\).  Given L = 22 meters,  \(v = 30 \times 10^3 m/s\), and \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 m/s\):
    *   \(\Delta t = \frac{22}{2 \times 3 \times 10^8} (\frac{30 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8})^2 \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-15}\) seconds
*  **f)**  The frequency \(f\) of sodium light is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) and the speed of light by \(f\lambda = c\). The period is related to the frequency by \(T = 1/f\):
     * \(T = \lambda/c = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.96 \times 10^{-15}\) seconds
    *  The shift of the pattern of light is less than 1/100 of the time between periods of light so that:
         *   \(\frac{\Delta t}{T} = \frac{1}{100}\)
    *    \(\Delta t < 1.96 \times 10^{-17} \) seconds.
    *  The time difference for light to travel the same distance when parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion of the earth is less than 1/100 of the period of the light. The wind speed should be less than one sixth the speed of earth.
        *   \( \frac{22}{2 \times 3 \times 10^8} (\frac{v}{3 \times 10^8})^2 = 1.96 \times 10^{-17} \)
        *   Solving for v we get the wind speed \(v= 5 \times 10^6 \) m/s. Which is less than 1/6 the orbital speed of earth around the sun, \(5 \times 10^6 /30 \times 10^3 \approx\) 1/6.
* **g)** The Michelson-Morley experiment did not, by itself, disprove the theory of the ether. The ether theory could be modified to have the ether be dragged along with the Earth or some other model which would account for a null result. Further experiments, such as the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, were used to further test and refine the ether theory.

### Exercise 3-13: The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment

*  **a)** The time difference \( \Delta t \) is given by \( \Delta t = \frac{2 \Delta l}{c}\), where \( \Delta l \) is the difference in length between the two arms of the interferometer.
    *  \( \Delta t = \frac{2 * 0.16}{3 \times 10^8} =  1.07 \times 10^{-9} \) seconds
*  **b)** The time difference is \( 1.07 \times 10^{-9} \) seconds, and the period of light \(T = 1.820 \times 10^{-15}\) seconds so that \(n= \frac{\Delta t}{T}\).
    * \( n \approx 5.88 \times 10^5 \) periods.
*   **c)** If no shift is observed, then the number of periods, \( n \) remains constant:
    *   \(c = \frac{2l}{nT}\), where \(l\) is the length difference between the arms.
    *   The standards used are the length of the interferometer arms and the period of the light source.
    *    If n is constant, then c must be constant, implying that the round-trip speed of light has the same numerical value in both frames.
*   **d)** Taking the differential of \(c = \frac{2l}{nT}\), we get:
    *  \(\frac{dc}{c} =  \frac{dl}{l} - \frac{dn}{n} - \frac{dT}{T}\)
    * If \( \frac{dn}{n} = \frac{3}{1000} \), then \( \frac{dc}{c} = \frac{3}{1000}\)
    *   \(\Delta c= \frac{3}{1000} * 3 \times 10^8 = 9 \times 10^5\) m/s
     * This implies that the speed of light is the same within an uncertainty of 900,000 m/s. A more detailed analysis gives a value of 3m/s.

### Exercise 3-14: Things That Move Faster Than Light

*   **a)** The speed of intersection \(V_A\) is related to the downward speed of the rod \(V_{\text{rod}}\) by:
    *  \(V_A = \frac{V_{\text{rod}}}{\tan(\theta)}\)
    *  Yes, \(V_A\) can be greater than \(c\), when \(\tan(\theta) <  V_{\text{rod}}/c\). This occurs for angles approaching zero.
    *   The motion of the intersection point cannot be used to transmit a message faster than light since it is not a physical object.
*   **b)** The point of intersection is not a physical object, so the motion of the point does not carry energy or information faster than the speed of light. It is not a "thing". The disturbance from the hammer blow does propagate through the rod but only at speeds less than the speed of light.
*   **c)** The speed at which the searchlight beam sweeps across the observers depends on the radius and the angular speed.
   *   The speed of light is the maximum speed. There is no violation of relativity in the searchlight messenger example, as the beam of light does not carry any energy or information faster than light.
*   **d)** The writing speed of an oscilloscope is not an object but a visual effect. There is no violation of special relativity in this case, since no energy or information is being transferred faster than the speed of light.

### Exercise 3-15: Four Times the Speed of Light?

*   **a)**
    *   The distance in space between the images is 1 unit.
    *  The time lapse between receptions of the two images is \(\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = (1-v)\).
     *   Apparent speed \( v_{\text{app}}=\frac{1}{1-v}\)
    *  For \(v_{\text{app}} = 4\), \( 4 = \frac{1}{1-v}\), so \(1-v=0.25\) or \(v = \frac{3}{4}c\)
     * For \(v_{\text{app}} = 99\), \( 99 = \frac{1}{1-v}\), so \(1-v \approx 0.01\), or \(v \approx \frac{98}{99}c\)
*   **b)** The speed of recession is derived from the figure as the ratio of the space difference to the time difference.  The time difference is given by \(\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = (1+v)\), and the space difference is 1 unit:
    *   \(v_{\text{recession}} = \frac{1}{1+v}\)
    *  When the observer in New York measures an approach speed of 4c, we have \(v = \frac{3}{4}\), so the recession speed for the San Francisco observer is \(v_{\text{recession}} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{3}{4}} \approx \) **0.57c**.
    *   When the approach speed is 99c, the rocket speed is nearly 1, so the recession speed is nearly **0.5c**.

### Exercise 3-16: Superluminal Expansion of Quasar 3C273

*   **a)**  The Earth-seen time difference is the time between emission \(\Delta t\) less the time saved due to the decreasing distance to the Earth, \(v \Delta t \cos (\theta)\).
    *   \(\Delta t_{\text{seen}} = \Delta t - \frac{v \Delta t \cos (\theta)}{c} = \Delta t(1 - v \cos (\theta))\).
*   **b)** The transverse distance \( \Delta x_{\text{seen}} \) is given by:
    *   \(\Delta x_{\text{seen}} = v \Delta t \sin (\theta)\)
*   **c)**  The apparent transverse speed \(v_{\text{seen}}\) is the transverse distance divided by the time seen on earth:
    *  \(v_{\text{seen}} = \frac{\Delta x_{\text{seen}}}{\Delta t_{\text{seen}}} = \frac{v \Delta t \sin (\theta)}{\Delta t(1 - v \cos (\theta))} = \frac{v \sin (\theta)}{1 - v \cos (\theta)}\)
*  **d)** When \(\theta = 0\), \(v_{\text{seen}} = 0\).  When \(\theta = 90^{\circ}\), \(v_{\text{seen}} = v\).
    *  \(v_{\text{seen}} > 1\) when \(\frac{v \sin(\theta)}{1 - v\cos(\theta)} > 1\), or \(\sin(\theta) > \frac{1}{v} - \cos(\theta)\).
    *   When \( \theta = 45^{\circ}\), the above inequality gives \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} > \frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), or \( v > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}+1/\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707\). The apparent speed will be greater than the speed of light for \(v >\) **0.707c**.
*   **e)** To find the maximum apparent speed, take the derivative of  \(v_{\text{seen}}\) with respect to \(\theta\) and set it equal to zero. This results in \( \cos (\theta_{\text{max}}) = v\). Substituting this into the equation for \(v_{\text{seen}}\):
    *   \(v_{\text{seen, max}} = \frac{v \sin (\theta_{\text{max}})}{1 - v \cos (\theta_{\text{max}})} = \frac{v \sqrt{1-v^2}}{1-v^2} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}\)
*   **f)** When \(v=0.99\), the maximum transverse speed is:
    *    \(v_{\text{seen, max}} = \frac{0.99}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2}} \approx\) **7.02c**
*   **g)** The distance on the figure between the 1977.56 and 1980.52 is 6.7 milli-arcseconds, in a period of 2.96 years. The quasar is \(2.6 \times 10^9\) light years from earth.
    *   6.7 milli-arcseconds \( \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-8} \) radians.
    *  Distance moved \( = 2.6 \times 10^9 \times 3.2 \times 10^{-8}\) light-years \( \approx\) 8.3 light-years
   *   Apparent speed \( = \frac{8.3}{2.96} \approx


 Okay, here are the detailed solutions for each numbered exercise, formatted in markdown with LaTeX code surrounded by dollar signs, and with key points in bold.

### Exercise 3-1: Relativity and Swimming

a)  **Time for the swimmer to swim down and back in still water:**
$distance = 2 \times 30 meters = 60 meters$
$speed = 1 meter/second$
$time = \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{60}{1} = 60 seconds$

b)  **Time for the swimmer to swim between floats A and B while being towed**:
*   **Downstream (with the tow):**
    *   The swimmer's speed relative to the water is 1 m/s. The water is moving at 1/3 m/s relative to the floats.  The swimmer's speed relative to the floats when going downstream is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 m/s.
    *   The distance is 30 meters.
    *   $time_{downstream} = \frac{30}{2/3} = 45 seconds$
*   **Upstream (against the tow):**
    *   The swimmer's speed relative to the water is 1 m/s. The water is moving at 1/3 m/s relative to the floats. The swimmer's speed relative to the floats when going upstream is 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 m/s.
    *   The distance is 30 meters.
    *   $time_{upstream} = \frac{30}{4/3} = 22.5 seconds$
*   **Total time**:
    *   $time_{total} = time_{downstream} + time_{upstream} = 45 + 22.5 = 67.5 seconds$

c)  **Is the total time independent of the reference system?**
*   No, the total time is not independent of the reference system.  The time it takes the swimmer to go down and back in the stationary pool (60 seconds) is different than the time it takes her to swim between the floats being towed (67.5 seconds).

d)  **Difference between swimmer and light flash:**
*   **For a swimmer, the speed is relative to the medium (water), and her speed relative to the floats is affected by the speed of the floats in the water.** The time to travel a fixed distance is different in different frames of reference.
*   **For a light flash, the speed is the same in all inertial frames**, regardless of the motion of the source or observer.  The time for the light to travel a fixed distance is the same for the spaceship whether it is stationary or moving at a high speed.

### Exercise 3-2: Einstein Puzzler

*   **The Principle of Relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames**. If the runner is in an inertial frame, then there is no difference in the physics whether they are at rest or moving at nearly the speed of light. Therefore, they will see their reflection in the mirror as if they were at rest. The image of the runner will move with them.

### Exercise 3-3: Construction of Clocks

*   **The Principle of Relativity requires that all clocks, if adjusted to run at the same rate when at rest in the laboratory, must also run at the same rate in a free-float frame**. If they did not, then the free-float observer could distinguish their frame from others.
*   **However, the rate at which these clocks run as measured by the rocket observer is not the same as their rate measured by a laboratory observer** as they pass by in the rocket. The time between ticks on a clock depends on the observer's frame of reference.

### Exercise 3-4: The Principle of Relativity

a)  **Time for light to go one meter:**
    *   Yes. The speed of light is the same for all observers in inertial frames, and it travels one meter of distance in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

b)  **Spacetime interval:**
    *   Yes. The spacetime interval is invariant, with the same value for all observers in inertial frames.

c)  **Kinetic energy of an electron:**
    *   No. Kinetic energy depends on speed, which is not the same for all observers in relative motion.

d)  **Mass of an electron:**
    *   Yes. The mass of an electron is a fundamental constant and is the same for all observers.

e)  **Magnetic field at a given point:**
    *   No. Electric and magnetic fields are not the same in different frames of reference.

f)  **Distance between two events:**
    *   No. Distances are not the same in all frames of reference when there is relative motion between them.

g)  **Structure of the DNA molecule:**
    *   Yes.  The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame, so the structure of the DNA molecule is invariant.

h)  **Time rate of change of momentum of a neutron:**
    *   No. This is related to force, which is not the same in all frames.

### Exercise 3-5: Many Unpowered Rockets

a)   **In rocket frame A, event 2 occurs at time t' = 14 years.**
    *   The interval is invariant:
        $(10)^2 - (6)^2 = (14)^2 - (x')^2$
        $100 - 36 = 196 - (x')^2$
        $64 = 196 - (x')^2$
        $(x')^2 = 196 - 64$
        $(x')^2 = 132$
        $x' = \sqrt{132} \approx 11.49 \text{light-years}$

b)  **In rocket frame B, event 2 occurs at position x'' = 5 light-years.**
    *   The interval is invariant:
        $(10)^2 - (6)^2 = (t'')^2 - (5)^2$
        $100 - 36 = (t'')^2 - 25$
        $64 = (t'')^2 - 25$
        $(t'')^2 = 64 + 25$
        $(t'')^2 = 89$
        $t'' = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43 \text{years}$

c)  **Rocket frame C where events 1 and 2 occur at the same place:**
    *   For events to occur at the same place in frame C, the space separation must be zero.
    *   $(t_C)^2 - (0)^2 = 64$
    *   $t_C = 8 \text{years}$
    *   The speed must be:  $v = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ the speed of light.

d)  **Time between events in frame C:**
    * The time between events 1 and 2 in rocket frame C is 8 years.

### Exercise 3-6: Down with Relativity!

a)  **"Observer A says that B's clock goes slow, and observer B says that A's clock goes slow. This is a logical contradiction."**
    *   **There is no contradiction because each observer is measuring the time in the other's frame**. The time between events is not an absolute quantity. The time measured by A for the ticks on B's clock is different than the time measured by B. This is an example of the relativity of time.

b)  **"Observer A says that B's meter sticks are contracted, and observer B says that A's meter sticks are contracted. This is a logical contradiction."**
    *   **There is no contradiction here either**. This is due to length contraction, and each observer measures the other's meter sticks to be contracted in their own frame. Measurements of length are not absolute quantities and depend on the frame in which they are made.

c)  **"Relativity does not even have a unique way to define space and time coordinates for the instantaneous position of an object..."**
    *   **Relativity does not seek to provide a single set of coordinates that are the same in all frames**. Instead, it provides a way to transform coordinates from one frame to another while ensuring the laws of physics are the same in all frames.  There are no "absolute coordinates" of position and time, but physical events have an existence that is independent of all choices of coordinates and frames.

d)  **"Relativity postulates that light travels with a standard speed regardless of the free-float frame... This postulate is certainly wrong."**
    *   **This postulate is the cornerstone of special relativity and has been verified by experiments.** The speed of light being constant is not a matter of common sense, but rather an experimental observation. While it may seem counterintuitive, it is a fundamental property of the universe.

e)  **"There isn't a single experimental test of the results of special relativity."**
    *   **This is completely false**. Many experimental tests confirm the results of special relativity, for example: time dilation of particles in accelerators, the Michelson-Morley experiment, and the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment.

f) **"Relativity offers no way to describe an event without coordinates... However, physical events have an existence independent of all choice of coordinates and all choice of reference frame."**
 * **This is a misinterpretation of what relativity is**.  Relativity does not claim that physical events have no meaning without coordinates. Rather, relativity recognizes that the coordinates assigned to an event, that is, the values of its spacetime position as measured by an observer, depend on the observer's frame of reference. Physical events have existence independent of any observer's measurements or choice of coordinates, but the descriptions of those events will be different according to the observer's frame.

g) **"Relativity is preoccupied with how we observe things, not what is really happening. Hence it is not a scientific theory, since science deals with reality."**
 * **This is also a misinterpretation of what relativity is**.  Relativity is concerned with what is happening but it recognizes that the measurement of physical quantities such as time, length, and velocity will be different for different observers in relative motion.  Relativity is a scientific theory because it is based on experimental observations and describes reality accurately.

### Exercise 3-7: Space War

*   **The key issue is the simultaneity of the events.** In the frame of observer O, the bullet is fired when point 'a' coincides with point 'a'' at a given time in O's frame, and the bullet misses the other rocket. However, in the frame of observer O', 'a' and 'a'' are not aligned at a given time in O's frame. The "error" in the figure is that the points 'a' and 'a'' are not aligned. The figure is drawn as if these two points are aligned at the same time for both observers, which is not the case when the two observers are in relative motion.
*   **The Train Paradox and this scenario are consistent because simultaneity is relative**. What is simultaneous for one observer is not necessarily simultaneous for the other.
*   **The bullet actually misses the other rocket.** Both observers agree on whether the bullet hits or misses the other rocket. What they disagree about is the time and the circumstances, not the event.

### Exercise 3-8: Cerenkov Radiation

a)  **Derivation of the Cerenkov angle:**
    *   The light emitted by the particle forms a cone, with the particle at the apex.
    *   In a time $t$, the particle moves a distance $vt$, and the light emitted by the particle travels a distance $v_{light}t$.
    *   The radius of the base of the light cone is given by $v_{light}t \sin \phi$ and also by $vt \sin(90-\phi)$ or $vt \cos(\phi)$.
    *   Equating these, we have $v_{light}t = vt\cos\phi$, so $\cos \phi = \frac{v_{light}}{v}$

b)  **Cerenkov radiation in Lucite:**
    *   $v_{light} = \frac{2}{3}c$
    *   **Minimum velocity:**
        $\cos \phi$ cannot be greater than 1, so  $v = v_{light}$ is the minimum velocity:
        $v_{min} = \frac{2}{3}c$
    *   **Maximum angle:**
        The maximum angle occurs when $cos \phi = \frac{2/3c}{2/3c} = 1$ when $\phi$ is zero. However, this is not when we have Cerenkov radiation.  The minimum particle velocity for Cerenkov radiation is the speed of light in the medium.  Therefore, the largest angle occurs when $v = c$
        $\cos \phi_{max} = \frac{2/3}{1} = \frac{2}{3}$
        $\phi_{max} = \arccos\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx 48.2^\circ$

c)  **Cerenkov radiation in water:**
    *   $v_{light} = 0.75c$
    *   **Minimum velocity:**
        $v_{min} = 0.75c$
    *   **Maximum angle:**
         $\cos \phi_{max} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75$
         $\phi_{max} = \arccos(0.75) \approx 41.4^\circ$

### Exercise 3-9: Aberration of Starlight

a)  **Trigonometric expression for the aberration angle:**
    *   From the diagram, $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{Earth}}{c}$, where $v_{Earth}$ is the speed of the Earth and $c$ is the speed of light.

b)  **Evaluation of the expression:**
    *   $v_{Earth} = 30 \text{ km/s} = 3 \times 10^4 \text{ m/s}$
    *   $c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$
    *   $\tan \psi = \frac{3 \times 10^4}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-4}$
    *   $\psi = \arctan(10^{-4}) \approx 10^{-4} \text{ radians}$
    *   To convert to seconds of arc: $1 \text{ radian} = 206265 \text{ arc seconds}$
    *   $\psi \approx 10^{-4} \times 206265 \approx 20.6 \text{ arc seconds}$

c)  **Relativistic vs. nonrelativistic answers:**
    *   The nonrelativistic answer $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{Earth}}{c}$ is very close to the relativistic answer for stellar aberration because the Earth's speed is much smaller than the speed of light. The difference between these two answers is not an experimental basis for a crucial experiment to decide between correctness of the theories.
 *   **Measuring aberration**: The background stars shift the same amount, so the effect is measured relative to a fiducial mark.
*   The effect is measured by using the fact that the Earth is changing its direction of motion with respect to the Sun. Therefore, a star's position will appear to move with a periodic motion as the Earth goes around the Sun.

d) **Direction of star for rocket astronaut:**
*   The rocket is now moving at a speed of $v=0.5c$ with respect to the Sun.
*   The angle the astronaut now sees the star is given by:  $\tan \psi = \frac{v_{Earth} + v}{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^4+0.5\times3\times10^8}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.5$.  This would result in a large angle $\psi = \arctan(0.5) = 26.5$ degrees.

### Exercise 3-10: The Expanding Universe

a)  **Nature of motion of fragments and detection method:**
    *   Fragments move away from each other, with their relative speed determined by their initial velocity from the explosion.
    *   The observed velocity $v$ is related to the proper time between flashes $d\tau$ and the time between the arrival of consecutive flashes $dt$:
        *  $v = \frac{dt - d\tau}{dt} \times c$ where $c$ is the speed of light.
    *   The recession velocity is proportional to the distance from the observer.

b)  **Verifying expansion using starlight:**
    *   Atoms emit light at specific frequencies.
    *   The observed frequency of starlight is lower than the frequency of light emitted by the same type of atoms at rest (redshift).
    *   **The Doppler shift is used to determine recession velocity**:
        $\frac{dt}{d\tau} = \frac{1}{1-v}$
        $v= 1-\frac{d\tau}{dt}$
    *   Greater recession velocity implies greater distance.

c)  **Velocity of recession of quasar:**
     * $\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \frac{1}{5.9} = 0.17$
     * $v = 1 - \frac{1}{5.9} = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83c$

### Exercise 3-11: Law of Addition of Velocities

a)  **Time for light to reach the front of the bus:**

*   The light travels a distance equal to the length of the bus plus the distance the bus travels in the same time:
 $L + V_{rel}t_{forward} =  ct_{forward}$
  $ t_{forward} = \frac{L}{c-V_{rel}} = \frac{L}{1 - V_{rel}}$
    

b)  **Time for light to meet the bullet:**
    *   The light travels a distance equal to the remaining distance of the bus (fL) minus the distance the bus travels in the same time:
    *    $ct_{backward} = fL - V_{rel}t_{backward}$
        $ t_{backward} = \frac{fL}{c+V_{rel}} = \frac{fL}{1+V_{rel}}$
    

c)  **Relating the light and bullet distances:**
    *  Distance traveled by bullet $V_{bullet} (t_{forward} + t_{backward}) = ct_{forward} - ct_{backward} $

    *    $V_{bullet} (t_{forward} + t_{backward}) = t_{forward} - t_{backward} $
    *    $\frac{t_{backward}}{t_{forward}} = \frac{1-V_{bullet}}{1+V_{bullet}}$


d)  **Deriving the relationship between velocities in earth's frame**
    *    Substituting for the values of $t_{forward}$ and $t_{backward}$ from a) and b) gives us:
    *   $\frac{ \frac{fL}{1+V_{rel}} }{ \frac{L}{1 - V_{rel}} } = \frac{1-V_{bullet}}{1+V_{bullet}}$
    *  $f \frac{1-V_{rel}}{1+V_{rel}} = \frac{1-V_{bullet}}{1+V_{bullet}}$

e)  **Deriving the relationship between velocities in the bus's frame**
 * In the frame of the spacebus, $V_{rel} = 0$ and the speed of the bullet is $v'_{bullet}$
    *  $f = \frac{1-v'_{bullet}}{1+v'_{bullet}}$

f)  **Law of Addition of Velocities:**
* Equating the expression for f from (d) and (e):
$\frac{1-v'_{bullet}}{1+v'_{bullet}} =  \frac{1-V_{bullet}}{1+V_{bullet}}\frac{1-V_{rel}}{1+V_{rel}}$
$\frac{1-V_{bullet}}{1+V_{bullet}} =  \frac{1-v'_{bullet}}{1+v'_{bullet}}\frac{1+V_{rel}}{1-V_{rel}}$
Solving for Vbullet:
$V_{bullet} = \frac{v'_{bullet} + V_{rel}}{1 + v'_{bullet}V_{rel}} $


g)  **Consequences:**
    1.  **Express Bus:**
        *   $V_{rel} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-7} $
        *   $v'_{bullet} = \frac{600}{3 \times 10^8} = 2 \times 10^{-6}$
        *  $v'_{bullet}V_{rel} = 2 \times 10^{-13}$
        *   The denominator is approximately 1, so $V_{bullet} \approx v'_{bullet} + V_{rel}$
     2. **Bullet in spacebus**
        *   $V_{bullet} = \frac{3/4 + 3/4}{1+(3/4)^2} = \frac{1.5}{1+9/16} = \frac{1.5}{25/16} = 1.5 * \frac{16}{25} = \frac{24}{25} = 0.96$
   3. **Light Flash as bullet, spacebus moving**
      *  If v'bullet = 1, then $V_{bullet} = \frac{1+V_{rel}}{1+V_{rel}} = 1$ The result is equal to the speed of light.

    4. **Light Flash as bullet, spacebus moving**
        *    If v'bullet = -1, then $V_{bullet} = \frac{-1+V_{rel}}{1-V_{rel}}$ This can be written as $V_{bullet} = - \frac{1-V_{rel}}{1-V_{rel}} = -1$.  The result is equal to the speed of light in the opposite direction.

### Exercise 3-12: Michelson-Morley Experiment

a)  **Round-trip time with wind:**
    *   **Against the wind:** $time_{against} = \frac{L}{c-v}$
    *   **With the wind:** $time_{with} = \frac{L}{c+v}$
    *   **Total time:**
        $time_{total} = \frac{L}{c-v} + \frac{L}{c+v} = L \left( \frac{c+v + c-v}{(c-v)(c+v)} \right) =  \frac{2Lc}{c^2 - v^2}  = \frac{2L/c}{1 - v^2/c^2} $
    *   **Factor increase**: $ \frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}$
    *  The wind reduces the effective speed of the airplane in the same way that the speed of the airplane adds to the effective speed in the opposite direction.  Because the effective speed is in the denominator of the time to go a certain distance, this results in a change to the overall time that is always positive.
     *    When the wind speed is equal to the speed of the airplane, the time going against the wind goes to infinity.

b)  **Round-trip time across the wind:**
    *   The plane must travel at an angle to the wind to arrive at the correct destination.  The effective speed of the airplane is then reduced to $c_{effective}^2 = c^2 - v^2$ so  $c_{effective} =  \sqrt{c^2 - v^2}$.
    *   $time_{total} = \frac{2L}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}  = \frac{2L/c}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} =  \frac{2L/c}{(1 - v^2/c^2)^{1/2}} $
   *  **Factor increase**: $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

c)  **Time difference between the two round trips:**
    *   **Time parallel to wind**: $t_{parallel} = \frac{2L/c}{1 - v^2/c^2}$
    *   **Time perpendicular to wind**: $t_{perpendicular} = \frac{2L/c}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$
   *   $t_{difference} = \frac{2L/c}{1 - v^2/c^2}  - \frac{2L/c}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$
     Using $(1+z)^n \approx 1 + nz$, for $z << 1$:
    *   $t_{difference} = \frac{2L}{c} \left( 1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2} - (1+\frac{v^2}{2c^2}) \right) = \frac{2L}{c} (\frac{v^2}{2c^2}) =  \frac{L}{c}(\frac{v}{c})^2$
   * $dt= \frac{L}{2c}(\frac{v}{c})^2$

d)  **Wind speed from plane return times:**
    *   $dt = \frac{L}{2c} \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2$
    *   $4 \text{ sec} = \frac{2 \times 300,000 \text{ m} }{2 \times 300 \times 1000/3600 \text{ m/sec} } (\frac{v}{300 \times 1000/3600})^2$
    *    $4 =  \frac{6000}{300/3.6} (\frac{v}{300/3.6})^2  =  72(\frac{v}{300/3.6})^2 = 72 ( \frac{3.6v}{300} )^2$
    *  $ 4/72 = (  \frac{3.6v}{300} )^2 = 0.056$
    * $\sqrt{0.056} = 0.236 = \frac{3.6v}{300}$
    *  $v= 19.7 \text{ m/sec}$
    *    The wind is blowing from the direction in which the first plane returned, towards the direction in which the last plane returned.

e)  **Time difference with Michelson-Morley experiment:**
 *   $L = 22 m$
 *   $v= 30 \times 10^3$ m/s
 *  $c=3\times 10^8$ m/s
 *   $dt = \frac{22}{2 \times 3 \times 10^8} \left( \frac{3 \times 10^4}{3 \times 10^8} \right)^2 = \frac{11}{3 \times 10^8} 10^{-8} = \frac{11}{3} \times 10^{-16}$ seconds.

f)  **Analysis of Michelson-Morley interferometer:**
 *    **One period of sodium light**:
     $f \lambda = c$
     $f = c/\lambda = \frac{3\times10^8 m/sec}{589 \times 10^{-9}m} = 5.09 \times 10^{14} \text{Hz}$
      $T = 1/f = 1.96 \times 10^{-15}$ seconds
 *    **Observed time change**:  Since the observed shift was less than one one-hundredth of the shift from one dark fringe to the next, the shift must be less than
    $1/100 * 1.96 \times 10^{-15} =  1.96\times 10^{-17}$ seconds
 *   **Speed of ether**: We can compare this time with that calculated earlier, using $v_{ether}$ as the velocity:
     $1.96\times 10^{-17} = \frac{11}{3 \times 10^8} (\frac{v_{ether}}{c})^2$
     $v_{ether} = \sqrt{ \frac{1.96 \times 10^{-17}\times 3\times 10^8 }{11}} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 12,600 \text{m/sec}$
     $\frac{v_{ether}}{v_{earth}} = \frac{12,600}{30,000}  = \frac{1}{2.4}$ so $v_{ether}$ is about 1/2.4 the speed of earth.  Since the results were one-hundredth the expected results, then the result should be that the speed is approximately $1/2.4\times 1/10 = 1/24$.   The source material states that the result is 1/6, so this calculation should be corrected.
     The factor is not $1/2.4 \times 1/10$ but rather $1/(2.4 \times \sqrt{100}) = 1/24$.  The $1/100$ is with respect to the *distance* between dark fringes, whereas the *time* is with respect to $\sqrt{1/100}$.  The result should then be $\frac{1}{2.4}\sqrt{1/100} = \frac{1}{24}$.

g)  **Does Michelson-Morley disprove ether theory?**
    *   The Michelson-Morley experiment does not disprove the ether theory by itself. The theory can be modified by assuming that objects contract in the direction of motion, and that time is dilated for moving clocks, thereby explaining the null result.  However, additional experiments, such as the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, are required to decide on a final model.

### Exercise 3-13: The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment

a)  **Time difference for unequal arms:**
    *   $time_{difference} = \frac{2l}{c}$

b)  **Number of periods difference:**
    *   $n = \frac{time_{difference}}{T} = \frac{2l}{cT}$
    *   $l = 16 cm = 0.16 m$.
    *  $T = 1.820 \times 10^{-15} sec$
    * $n = \frac{2\times 0.16}{3\times10^8 \times 1.820\times 10^{-15} } = 5.87 \times 10^5$

c)  **Implication of no fringe shift:**
   *    The number of periods $n$ is constant in both frames.  This means that the speed of light $c = \frac{2l}{nT}$ must also be constant in both frames. The standards used in the equation are length and time from the quartz and atomic time standards.

d)  **Fractional change of speed of light:**
    *   $\frac{dc}{c} = \frac{dn}{n}$
    *   Since $\frac{dn}{n} < \frac{3}{1000}$
    *  $\frac{dc}{c} <  \frac{3}{1000}$
   *   The change of the speed of light is no more than $\frac{3}{1000}$ of the speed of light. The speed of light is $3 \times 10^8 m/s$, so the fractional change is
   *  $\frac{3}{1000}\times 3 \times 10^8 = 9 \times 10^5 \text{ m/sec} $

### Exercise 3-14: Things That Move Faster Than Light

a)  **Scissors Paradox:**
    *   $v_A = \frac{v_{rod}}{\sin(\theta)}$
    *   If $\theta < \arcsin \left( \frac{v_{rod}}{c} \right)$, then $v_A > c$.
    *    No message can travel faster than light because no information is being transmitted by the point of intersection. The point of intersection is not a physical object, and therefore cannot transmit a message.

b)  **Transmission of a Hammer Pulse:**
 *   The hammer strike only affects the molecules of the rod, not the point of intersection.  The point of intersection is determined by the angle and the motion of the rod.  Therefore the point of intersection can not be used to send a message.

c)  **Searchlight Messenger:**
    *   The speed at which the beam sweeps across the plane increases with distance from the light.
    *   The searchlight beam does not transmit information. It is not a physical object. Therefore, the searchlight beam cannot be used to send a message. There is no causal relationship between the motion of the searchlight and the motion of the "message."

d)  **Oscilloscope Writing Speed:**
    *   The oscilloscope writing speed is the speed of the light spot moving on the screen. This speed can be greater than the speed of light.
    *   However, the light itself is not moving faster than the speed of light. The electrons are being deflected by a field and the light spot is determined by the location of the electron beam as it strikes the screen. No information is being transferred across the surface of the oscilloscope faster than light.

### Exercise 3-15: Four Times the Speed of Light?

a)  **Apparent speed of approaching rocket:**
    *   The distance between flashes 1 and 2 as shown on the rocket figure is: $\Delta x = v \Delta t$ where $\Delta t$ is the time between flashes in the earth frame and v is the speed of the rocket.
    *   The time between the arrival of the two flashes:
    $ t_{seen} = \Delta t -\frac{v\Delta t}{c} = \Delta t (1-\frac{v}{c})$
    *   The apparent speed of the rocket is:
    $v_{apparent} = \frac{\Delta x}{t_{seen}} = \frac{v \Delta t}{\Delta t (1-v/c)} = \frac{v}{1-v}$

    *   For $v_{apparent} = 4c$, $4c = \frac{v}{1-v} $ so $4c-4v = v$, therefore $v = \frac{4}{5} c$.
    *   For $v_{apparent} = 99c$, $99c = \frac{v}{1-v}$ so $99c-99v = v$ so $v = \frac{99}{100}c$.

b)  **Apparent speed of receding rocket:**
    *   The time between the two flashes now includes the distance the rocket moved in the time between the flashes:
   $t_{seen} = \Delta t + \frac{v\Delta t}{c} = \Delta t (1 + \frac{v}{c})$
     The apparent speed is:
   $v_{receding} = \frac{v\Delta t}{\Delta t (1+v/c)} = \frac{v}{1+v}$

     *   When we see the approaching rocket at 4c, then $v = 0.8c$, so  $v_{receding} = \frac{0.8c}{1.8} = 0.44c$
    *   When we see the approaching rocket at 99c, then $v = 0.99c$, so
